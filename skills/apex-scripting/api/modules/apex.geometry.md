The tessellation objects could be discontinuous, which would then end up creating more than one facet body for one tessellation object.
- `meshBody` — An optional argument that to supply a list of MeshBodies. If supplied, the attributes of the MeshBodies (Materials, Sections) and Loads or Constraints that are applied to the MeshBodies will be transferred from the MeshBodies to the FacetedSurfaces.

It is not useful, and can give poor results if the model is an organic shape with no real analytical shapes in it.
- `cleanupNURBS` — An optional argument (default = True) to control cleanup of any NURBS geometry bodies that are created. If True, all geometry bodies will processed to remove faults and to replace NURBS based topology with analytical representations where possible.

- `convertToSolid` — An optional boolean argument (default = True) to control whether or not watertight/closed NURBS Surfaces should be converted to Solids or left as Surfaces. If True, all NURBS geometry bodies will processed to determine if they represent a closed volume and if so the body will be converted to a NURBS Solid, otherwise the body will be a Surface. If False, no processing will be carried out on the generated NURBS bodies and they will remain as Surfaces This argument will be silently ignored if createNURBS is False (no NURBS bodies requested)
- `smoothLevel` — This controls how much smoothing will be applied to the created NURBS faces. High values can lose some detail in the face or lose its curvature. Low values can allow noise or rough faces to be created if the input data is not very clean.

- `target` — an input list of Curves to stitch

Returns: Collectoin of created or modified curves

### `apex.geometry.stitchSurfaces(target: apex.EntityCollection, tolerance: float, createSolidIfWatertight: bool, ignoreStitchTolerance: bool, stitchFreeEdgesOnly: bool = True, stitchIntersectingFaces: bool = True) -> apex.geometry.GeometryBodyCollection`
stitch surfaces

- `target` — collection of any type of surface body
- `tolerance` — stitch tolerance
- `createSolidIfWatertight` — if solid is sheetbody that holds water, it will convert to solid
- `ignoreStitchTolerance` — This increases the stitch tolerance to try and "force a stitch"
- `stitchFreeEdgesOnly` — If true (default), the method will attempt to stitch only free Edges from the Surfaces and will ignore interior Surface Edges. If false the method will attempt to stitch all of the Edges in the Surface
- `stitchIntersectingFaces` — If true (default), the method will identify faces that intersect each other and will attempt to generate Edges at each intersection and subsequently stitch these Edges. If false, the method will not attempt to create Edges at Face intersections and will consider only existing Edges from the target Faces

Returns: Collection of stitched surfaces

### `apex.geometry.subtractBoolean(target: apex.EntityCollection, subtractingEntity: apex.EntityCollection, retainOriginalBodies: bool) -> apex.EntityCollection`
boolean subtract subtractingEntity from target

- `target` — collection of solids or surfaces
- `subtractingEntity` — subtracting solid or surface
- `retainOriginalBodies` — Flag to keep subtracting entity. Deleted when False.

Returns: Collection of modified bodies

### `apex.geometry.suppressOnly(target: apex.EntityCollection, maxEdgeAngle: float, maxFaceAngle: float, keepVerticesAtCurvatureChange: bool, cleanupTol: float, forceSuppress: bool = False) -> apex.EntityCollection`
Suppress target if not suppressed.

- `target` — collection Suppress target collection (Edge or Vertex) if not suppressed.
- `maxEdgeAngle` — edge angle for controling which vertex are suppressed in box picking
- `maxFaceAngle` — face angle for controling which edges are suppressed in box picking
- `keepVerticesAtCurvatureChange` — contoroles if key vertex at curvature changes should be retained.
- `cleanupTol` — controls how vertex close together are handled
- `forceSuppress` — controls if ignoring angle setting and keepVerticesAtCurvatureChange

Returns: Collection of suppressed entities

### `apex.geometry.suppressToggle(target: apex.EntityCollection, maxEdgeAngle: float = NAN, maxFaceAngle: float = NAN, keepVerticesAtCurvatureChange: bool = False, cleanupTol: float = NAN, forceSuppress: bool = False) -> [apex.EntityCollection]`
Suppress or unsuppress entities.

- `target` — collection, If edge is suppressed, unsuppress, and if unsuppressed, suppress it.
- `maxEdgeAngle` — edge angle for controling which vertex are suppressed in box picking
- `maxFaceAngle` — face angle for controling which edges are suppressed in box picking
- `keepVerticesAtCurvatureChange` — contoroles if key vertex at curvature changes should be retained.
- `cleanupTol` — controls how vertex close together are handled
- `forceSuppress` — controls if ignoring angle setting and keepVerticesAtCurvatureChange

Returns: tuple of two lists, list of suppressed entities, list of unsuppressed entities

### `apex.geometry.surfaceCollection(surfaceList: [Surface] = []) -> SurfaceCollection`
This function has been deprecated and we intend to remove it in the next Apex release. Instead use the standard constuctor apex.geometry.SurfaceCollection().

- `surfaceList` — optional list of Surfaces to add to the collection.

### `apex.geometry.unstitchCurves(target: apex.EntityCollection) -> apex.geometry.CurveCollection`
This function works similar to unstitchSurfaces, but for Curves instead. It takes as input a list of Edges or Curves. For each set of contiguously connected Edges from a single Body, it disconnects them into one new Curve. If a Curve is selected that is non-manifolded or a Generalbody, it converts it into a minimum set of regular Curve Bodies. If a selected Curve is already manifolded, no operation is performed.

- `target` — Collection of curves and or edges to unstitch

Returns: Collection of unstitched curves

### `apex.geometry.unstitchSurfaces(target: apex.EntityCollection) -> apex.geometry.SurfaceCollection`
un-stitch surfaces

- `target` — The collection of faces or a general body

Returns: Collection of unstitched surfaces

### `apex.geometry.unsuppressOnly(target: apex.EntityCollection) -> apex.EntityCollection`
Unsuppress selected edges if they are suppressed.

- `target` — collection unsuppress selected edges collection if they are suppressed

Returns: Collection of unsuppressed entities
