#### `exportFEModel(filename: str, unitSystem: str, exportWideFormat: bool = False, exportHierarchicalFiles: bool = False, renumberMethod: apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod = apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod.Internal, exportAbstractions: bool = False, writePropertyOnElement: bool = True, exportProperty: apex.ExportProperty = apex.ExportProperty.AsDefined) -> None`
Exports the contents of the Assembly to a Nastran file. All objects in the Assembly that can be mapped to Nastran keywords will be exported. Only bulk data entries are exported when this method is called from the Assembly class - to export Case (and other Nastran file sections) use the equivalent method on the Scenario class instead. The method arguments provide control over export options.

- `filename` — The path qualified name of the file that will be exported.
- `unitSystem` — The name of a consistent unit system to use when exporting Nastran files, for example "mm-kg-s-N", "in-slinch-s-lbf".
- `exportWideFormat` — A boolean value that controls whether the exported data is written using Nastran Wide format (16 characters per keyword field) or not. The default value is "False" - causing the data to be written in narrow format (8 characters per field).
- `exportHierarchicalFiles` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the exported data is written as a series of hierarchical include files that mirrors the Assembly/Part product structure, or as a single flat file. The default value of "False" causes a single file to be written containing all of the finite element entities within the Assembly to be written.
- `renumberMethod` — An enumeration to control how renumbering of finite element entities is handled if duplicate ID's are detected within the scope of the exported Assembly Apex supports duplicate ID's for most finite element entities including Nodes and Elements, however most Nastran jobs require these ID's to be unique within the scope of the Nastran run. This enumeration is used to control how Apex resolves duplicate ID's when models are being exported as Nastran files. Two options are provided, "apex.attributes.ExportRenumberMethod.internal" causes the renumbering operation to carried out and persisted in the Apex Model. "apex.attributes.ExportRenumberMethod.export" causes the renumbering operation to be applied ONLY to the exported Nastran file and has no impact on the ID's within Apex.
- `exportAbstractions` — Optional boolean argument (Default = False) that controls whether the exported file will include Nastran ABSTRCT and/or NAMVAL keywords that preserve Apex specific data, not directly support by Nastran, within the Nastran file. This data passes through the solver to the output .h5 file without otherwise impacting the solution and can be used during a subsequent import of the Nastran model to Apex to reconstruct "rich" Apex objects from the "raw" Nastran keywords.
- `writePropertyOnElement` — Optional boolean argument (Default = True) that controls whether the property is written on element entry or it is written as a separated entry in the exported file.
- `exportProperty` — Optional argument to control the way how the property is exported, the default value is "AsDefined", unless one of other two values are given : "Inline" or "External". If "AsDefined" is given, then the property will be exported according to the defined way in Apex, for example : one spring is defined with "Embedded" property, then this spring is exported as CLEAS2; one spring is referring a existed property through "Use property" method, then this spring is exported as CELAS1 and PELAS. If "Inline" is given, the property will be written in the element entry If "External" is given, the property will be written as a separated nastran entry Damper has the same behavior during exporting with different setting for this argument.

#### `exportGeometry(filename: str, cadFormat: apex.geometry.CADFormat, unitSystem: str = "m", stlMergeCells: bool = True, exportVirtualFaces: bool = False, exportVirtualFaceMethod: apex.VirtualFaceExportMethod = apex.VirtualFaceExportMethod.NurbsOnly, exportBodyPositionInLocal: bool = False) -> None`
Export Geometry from this assembly to a file using the supplied CAD format.

- `filename` — Fully qualified name of the file to which the geometry objects will be exported.
- `cadFormat` — defines the format of the CAD file that will be exported using an apex.geometry.CADFormat enumeration.
- `unitSystem` — A string to identify the units to be used during export. Unit support is dependent on the CADFormat of the exported file and not all formats support units. Of the CAD formats currently supported by Apex, only the IGES format supports user defined export units. The table below shows each of the supported unit systems and associated unitSystem values for IGES export CAD Format - Length unit - unitSystem value IGES Kilometer km Meter m Centimeter cm Millimeter mm Micrometer um Mile mile Foot ft Inch in Milliinch mi Microinch ui If the IGES format is selected, unitSystem must be provided. If a value other than one in the above table is supplied, the method will throw an exception
- `stlMergeCells` — optional Boolean argument (default = True) that controls how multi-cellular solids will be represented in STL files. This argument is only relevant when the cadFormat type is an STL type and is silently ignored for all other formats. When True (Default), all cells in a multi-cellular solid will be merged into a single cell during export by removing all internal Faces. The GeometryBody is unaffected by this operation. When False, all cells in multi-cellular solids will be present in the exported STL file.
- `exportVirtualFaces` — Optional Argument, Default = False, where each virtual faces will be exported as a single face. This only applies to CAD Format Parasolid. The purpose is to export geometry topology that is consistent with native Apex to maintaining associatively with mesh, loads, BCs and other attributes. An attempt will be made to export the virtual faces as NURBS, by replacing the each virtual face with a single NURBS face. If this fails, then a facet body face will be used instead.
- `exportVirtualFaceMethod` — This applies to exportGeometry API only. It controls what is permitted for converting virtual topology to exportable faces with the same topology. This is ignored if exportVirtualFaces is False. If set to NurbsAndFaceted, then the system will try to convert to NURBS, and if that fails, it will then convert the face into a faceted face. If set to NurbsOnly (Default), then it will try to convert each virtual face to NURBS only.
- `exportBodyPositionInLocal` — Optional Boolean argument to export the geometry body in local position based the reference system of the body and parent part. By default, it is false. The system will export the geometry body position in global.

#### `exportMarc(filename: str, unitSystem: str, exportWideFormat: bool = False, exportHierarchicalFiles: bool = False, renumberMethod: apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod = apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod.Internal, exportAbstractions: bool = False) -> None`
Exports the contents of the Assembly to a Marc file. All objects in the Assembly that can be mapped to Marc keywords will be exported. Only bulk data entries are exported when this method is called from the Assembly class - to export Case (and other Marc file sections) use the equivalent method on the Scenario class instead. The method arguments provide control over export options.

- `filename` — The path qualified name of the file that will be exported.
- `unitSystem` — The name of a consistent unit system to use when exporting Nastran files, for example "mm-kg-s-N", "in-slinch-s-lbf".
- `exportWideFormat` — A boolean value that controls whether the exported data is written using Nastran Wide format (16 characters per keyword field) or not. The default value is "False" - causing the data to be written in narrow format (8 characters per field).
- `exportHierarchicalFiles` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the exported data is written as a series of hierarchical include files that mirrors the Assembly/Part product structure, or as a single flat file. The default value of "False" causes a single file to be written containing all of the finite element entities within the Assembly to be written.
- `renumberMethod` — An enumeration to control how renumbering of finite element entities is handled if duplicate ID's are detected within the scope of the exported Assembly Apex supports duplicate ID's for most finite element entities including Nodes and Elements, however most Nastran jobs require these ID's to be unique within the scope of the Nastran run. This enumeration is used to control how Apex resolves duplicate ID's when models are being exported as Nastran files. Two options are provided, "apex.attributes.ExportRenumberMethod.internal" causes the renumbering operation to carried out and persisted in the Apex Model. "apex.attributes.ExportRenumberMethod.export" causes the renumbering operation to be applied ONLY to the exported Nastran file and has no impact on the ID's within Apex.
- `exportAbstractions` — Optional boolean argument (Default = False) that controls whether the exported file will include Nastran ABSTRCT and/or NAMVAL keywords that preserve Apex specific data, not directly support by Nastran, within the Nastran file. This data passes through the solver to the output .h5 file without otherwise impacting the solution and can be used during a subsequent import of the Nastran model to Apex to reconstruct "rich" Apex objects from the "raw" Nastran keywords.

adds Assembly/ AssemblyRep/ Part/ apex.attribute.MeshDependentTie/ apex.attribute.DiscreteTie to an AssemblyRep

- `target` — a single target to be added to the current AssembyRep.
- `targets` — collection targets to be added to the current AssemblyRep.

#### `exportFEModel(filename: str, unitSystem: str, exportWideFormat: bool = False, exportHierarchicalFiles: bool = False, renumberMethod: apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod = apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod.Internal, exportAbstractions: bool = False, writePropertyOnElement: bool = True, exportProperty: apex.ExportProperty = apex.ExportProperty.AsDefined) -> None`
Exports the contents of the AssemblyRep to a Nastran file. All objects in the AssemblyRep that can be mapped to Nastran keywords will be exported. Only bulk data entries are exported when this method is called from the Assembly class - to export Case (and other Nastran file sections) use the equivalent method on the Scenario class instead. The method arguments provide control over export options.

- `filename` — The path qualified name of the file that will be exported.
- `unitSystem` — The name of a consistent unit system to use when exporting Nastran files, for example "mm-kg-s-N", "in-slinch-s-lbf".
- `exportWideFormat` — A boolean value that controls whether the exported data is written using Nastran Wide format (16 characters per keyword field) or not. The default value is "False" - causing the data to be written in narrow format (8 characters per field).
- `exportHierarchicalFiles` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the exported data is written as a series of hierarchical include files that mirrors the Assembly/Part product structure, or as a single flat file. The default value of "False" causes a single file to be written containing all of the finite element entities within the Assembly to be written.
- `renumberMethod` — An enumeration to control how renumbering of finite element entities is handled if duplicate ID's are detected within the scope of the exported Assembly Apex supports duplicate ID's for most finite element entities including Nodes and Elements, however most Nastran jobs require these ID's to be unique within the scope of the Nastran run. This enumeration is used to control how Apex resolves duplicate ID's when models are being exported as Nastran files. Two options are provided, "apex.attributes.ExportRenumberMethod.internal" causes the renumbering operation to carried out and persisted in the Apex Model. "apex.attributes.ExportRenumberMethod.export" causes the renumbering operation to be applied ONLY to the exported Nastran file and has no impact on the ID's within Apex.
- `exportAbstractions` — Optional boolean argument (Default = False) that controls whether the exported file will include Nastran ABSTRCT and/or NAMVAL keywords that preserve Apex specific data, not directly support by Nastran, within the Nastran file. This data passes through the solver to the output .h5 file without otherwise impacting the solution and can be used during a subsequent import of the Nastran model to Apex to reconstruct "rich" Apex objects from the "raw" Nastran keywords.
- `writePropertyOnElement` — Optional boolean argument (Default = True) that controls whether the property is written on element entry or it is written as a separated entry in the exported file.
- `exportProperty` — Optional argument to control the way how the property is exported, the default value is "AsDefined", unless one of other two values are given : "Inline" or "External". If "AsDefined" is given, then the property will be exported according to the defined way in Apex, for example : one spring is defined with "Embedded" property, then this spring is exported as CLEAS2; one spring is referring a existed property through "Use property" method, then this spring is exported as CELAS1 and PELAS. If "Inline" is given, the property will be written in the element entry If "External" is given, the property will be written as a separated nastran entry Damper has the same behavior during exporting with different setting for this argument.

#### `exportMarc(filename: str, unitSystem: str, exportWideFormat: bool = False, exportHierarchicalFiles: bool = False, inputType: apex.attribute.MarcInputType = apex.attribute.MarcInputType.Dat, renumberMethod: apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod = apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod.Internal, apexEngineeringAbstractions: bool = False) -> None`

- `exportWideFormat` — A boolean value that controls whether the exported data is written using Nastran Wide format (16 characters per keyword field) or not. The default value is "False" - causing the data to be written in narrow format (8 characters per field)
- `exportHierarchicalFiles` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the exported data is written as a series of hiearchical include files that mirrors the Assmbly/Part product structure, or as a singel Flat file. The default for this argument is "False" - causing a single Flat file containing the entire model (matching the scope of the xport) to be written
- `inputType` — An enumeration to define which Marc input file format will be requested in the exported file. The default is DAT input file
- `renumberMethod` — Nastran jobs require these ID's to be unique within the scope of the Nastran run. This enumeration is used to control how Apex resolves duplicate ID's when models are being exported as Nastran files. Two options are provided, "internal" causes the renumbering operation to carried out and persisted in the Apex Model. "export" causes the renumbering operation to be applied ONLY to the exported Marc file and has no impact on the ID's within Apex.
- `apexEngineeringAbstractions` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the exported data contains Apex Engineering Abstractions.

#### `createModelAssociation(name: str, description: str, primaryAssembly: apex.Assembly, secondaryAssembly: apex.Assembly) -> ModelAssociation`
Creates and returns a ModelAssociation. ModelAssociations enable associations to be defined between two top level Assemblies in a Model. One of the Assemblies is defined to be the "Primary" Assembly and the other to be the "Secondary" Assembly and individual Each Part in the primary Assembly can be associated with one or more Parts or Assemblies in the secondary Assembly. Parts/Assemblies in the secondary Assembly can only be associated to one Part in the primary Assembly. ModelAssociations are used to connect two different representations of the same model. Current Apex releases use ModelAssociations to enable, 1.animation of CAD or finite element models based on the results of an Adams/Car multi-body dynamics simulation. In his case, the multibody dynamics model (results) are generated by importing an Adams/Car model (and results). The multi-body dynamics model is added to a ModelAssociation as the primary assembly and a second Assembly containing CAD or finite element entities is included as the secondary Assembly. Individual Parts form the multiboidy model (primary assembly) are then associated with one or more Parts/Assemblies from the CAD/finite element model.

#### `exportFEModel(filename: str, unitSystem: str, exportWideFormat: bool = False, exportHierarchicalFiles: bool = False, renumberMethod: apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod = apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod.Internal, exportAbstractions: bool = False, writePropertyOnElement: bool = True, exportProperty: apex.ExportProperty = apex.ExportProperty.AsDefined) -> None`
Exports the Model in Nastran bulk data file format. All objects in the Model that can be mapped to Nastran keywords will be exported. Only the bulk data entries are exported when this method is called from the Model class, although a small subset of case control keywords are also exported to enable import of mesh independent ties into the other applications. To export case control entries, use the equivalent exportFEModel() method on the Scenario object.

- `filename` — Fully qualified name of the file to which the finite element objects will be exported.
- `unitSystem` — The name of a consistent unit system to use when exporting Nastran files. The valid unit system names are "m-kg-s-N"; // Standard SI units (meter-kilogram-second) "cm-kg-s-cN"; // SI units with length in centimeters "cm-kg-ms-dakN"; // SI units with length in centimeters and time in milliseconds "cm-kg-us-daGN"; // SI units with length in centimeters and time in microseconds "mm-kg-ms-kN"; // SI units with length in millimeters and time in milliseconds "cm-g-s-dyn"; // Standard centimeter-gram-second (CGS) units "cm-g-us-daMN"; // CGS units with time in microseconds "mm-g-s-uN"; // CGS units with length in millimeters "mm-g-ms-N"; // CGS units with length in millimeters and time in milliseconds "mm-t-s-N"; // SI units with length in millimeters and mass in metric tons "in-slinch-s-lbf"; // English engineering units with mass in slinches (1 slinch = 12 slugs) "ft-slug-s-lbf"; // English engineering units with mass in slugs (1 slug = 32.174 pounds) "mm-khyl-s-kgf"; // Kilogram-force units with mass in kilohyls and length in millimeters "mm-kg-s-mN"; // SI units with length in millimeters "cm-g-ms-daN"; // CGS units with time in milliseconds "ft-lb-s-lbf"; // Standard English engineering units (foot-pound-second)
- `exportWideFormat` — A boolean value that controls whether the exported data is written using Nastran Wide format (16 characters per keyword field) or not. The default value is "False" - causing the data to be written in narrow format (8 characters per field).
- `exportHierarchicalFiles` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the exported data is written as a series of hierarchical include files that mirrors the Assembly/Part product structure, or as a single flat file. The default value of "False" causes a single file to be written containing all of the finite element entities within the Assembly to be written.
- `renumberMethod` — An enumeration to control how renumbering of finite element entities is handled if duplicate ID's are detected within the scope of the exported Model Apex supports duplicate ID's for most finite element entities including Nodes and Elements, however most Nastran jobs require these ID's to be unique within the scope of the Nastran run. This enumeration is used to control how Apex resolves duplicate ID's when models are being exported as Nastran files. Two options are provided, "internal" causes the renumbering operation to carried out and persisted in the Apex Model. "export" causes the renumbering operation to be applied ONLY to the exported Nastran file and has no impact on the ID's within Apex.
- `exportAbstractions` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the exported data contains Apex Engineering Abstractions.
- `writePropertyOnElement` — Optional boolean argument (Default = True) that controls whether the property is written on element entry or it is written as a separated entry in the exported file.
- `exportProperty` — Optional argument to control the way how the property is exported, the default value is "AsDefined", unless one of other two values are given : "Inline" or "External". If "AsDefined" is given, then the property will be exported according to the defined way in Apex, for example : one spring is defined with "Embedded" property, then this spring is exported as CLEAS2; one spring is referring a existed property through "Use property" method, then this spring is exported as CELAS1 and PELAS. If "Inline" is given, the property will be written in the element entry If "External" is given, the property will be written as a separated nastran entry Damper has the same behavior during exporting with different setting for this argument.

#### `exportGeometry(filename: str, cadFormat: apex.geometry.CADFormat, unitSystem: str = "m", stlMergeCells: bool = True, exportVirtualFaces: bool = False, exportVirtualFaceMethod: apex.VirtualFaceExportMethod = apex.VirtualFaceExportMethod.NurbsOnly, exportGeometryOrganization: apex.GeometryExportOrganization = apex.GeometryExportOrganization.Multiple, exportBodyPositionInLocal: bool = False) -> None`
Export Geometry file from this model to a file using the supplied CAD format.

- `cadFormat` — defines the format of the CAD file that will be exported using an apex.geometry.CADFormat enumeration.
- `unitSystem` — A string to identify the units to be used during export. Unit support is dependent on the CADFormat of the exported file and not all formats support units.Of the CAD formats currently supported by Apex, only the IGES/STL format supports user defined export units. The support Length unit: m, cm, mm, ft, in If the IGES/STL format is selected, unitSystem will be available. If it is undefined, use the default unitSystem = m. If a value other than one in the above unit is supplied, the method will throw an exception
- `stlMergeCells` — optional Boolean argument (default = True) that controls how multi-cellular solids will be represented in STL files. This argument is only relevant when the cadFormat type is an STL type and is silently ignored for all other formats. When True (Default), all cells in a multi-cellular solid will be merged into a single cell during export by removing all internal Faces. The GeometryBody is unaffected by this operation. When False, all cells in multi-cellular solids will be present in the exported STL file.
- `exportVirtualFaces` — Optional Argument, Default = False, where each virtual faces will be exported as a single face. This only applies to CAD Format Parasolid. The purpose is to export geometry topology that is consistent with native Apex to maintaining associatively with mesh, loads, BCs and other attributes. An attempt will be made to export the virtual faces as NURBS, by replacing the each virtual face with a single NURBS face. If this fails, then a facet body face will be used instead.
- `exportVirtualFaceMethod` — This applies to exportGeometry API only. It controls what is permitted for converting virtual topology to exportable faces with the same topology. This is ignored if exportVirtualFaces is False. If set to NurbsAndFaceted, then the system will try to convert to NURBS, and if that fails, it will then convert the face into a faceted face. If set to NurbsOnly (Default), then it will try to convert each virtual face to NURBS only.
- `exportGeometryOrganization` — Optional argument which specifies whether the model with multiple top level parts is exported as multiple files or single file.
- `exportBodyPositionInLocal` — Optional Boolean argument to export the geometry body in local position based the reference system of the body and parent part. By default, it is false. The system will export the geometry body position in global.

#### `exportMarc(filename: str, unitSystem: str, exportWideFormat: bool = False, exportHierarchicalFiles: bool = False, renumberMethod: apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod = apex.attribute.ExportRenumberMethod.Internal, exportAbstractions: bool = False) -> None`
Exports the contents of the Model to a Marc file. All objects in the Model that can be mapped to Marc keywords will be exported. If the Model contains multiple top level Parts or Assemblies the method will throw an exception. Use the equivalent method on each top Level Part or Asssembly instead or re-organize your model into a singel top level Assembly. The method arguments provide control over export options. Only bulk data entries are exported when this method is called from the Model class - to export Case (and other Marc file sections) use the equivalent method on the Scenario class instead. The method arguments provide control over export options.

- `filename` — Fully qualified name of the file to which the finite element objects will be exported.
- `unitSystem` — The name of a consistent unit system to use when exporting Nastran files. The valid unit system names are "m-kg-s-N"; // Standard SI units (meter-kilogram-second) "cm-kg-s-cN"; // SI units with length in centimeters "cm-kg-ms-dakN"; // SI units with length in centimeters and time in milliseconds "cm-kg-us-daGN"; // SI units with length in centimeters and time in microseconds "mm-kg-ms-kN"; // SI units with length in millimeters and time in milliseconds "cm-g-s-dyn"; // Standard centimeter-gram-second (CGS) units "cm-g-us-daMN"; // CGS units with time in microseconds "mm-g-s-uN"; // CGS units with length in millimeters "mm-g-ms-N"; // CGS units with length in millimeters and time in milliseconds "mm-t-s-N"; // SI units with length in millimeters and mass in metric tons "in-slinch-s-lbf"; // English engineering units with mass in slinches (1 slinch = 12 slugs) "ft-slug-s-lbf"; // English engineering units with mass in slugs (1 slug = 32.174 pounds) "mm-khyl-s-kgf"; // Kilogram-force units with mass in kilohyls and length in millimeters "mm-kg-s-mN"; // SI units with length in millimeters "cm-g-ms-daN"; // CGS units with time in milliseconds "ft-lb-s-lbf"; // Standard English engineering units (foot-pound-second)
- `exportWideFormat` — A boolean value that controls whether the exported data is written using Nastran Wide format (16 characters per keyword field) or not. The default value is "False" - causing the data to be written in narrow format (8 characters per field).
- `exportHierarchicalFiles` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the exported data is written as a series of hierarchical include files that mirrors the Assembly/Part product structure, or as a single flat file. The default value of "False" causes a single file to be written containing all of the finite element entities within the Assembly to be written.
- `renumberMethod` — An enumeration to control how renumbering of finite element entities is handled if duplicate ID's are detected within the scope of the exported Model Apex supports duplicate ID's for most finite element entities including Nodes and Elements, however most Nastran jobs require these ID's to be unique within the scope of the Nastran run. This enumeration is used to control how Apex resolves duplicate ID's when models are being exported as Nastran files. Two options are provided, "internal" causes the renumbering operation to carried out and persisted in the Apex Model.

Imports a target CAD model from the input CAD files and returns a Dictionary representing the Part / Assembly structure of that CAD model. If preview option is set as "False" by default, import geometry will return dictionary{ str: apex.entity }.The returned dictionary has keys of type string and values of type apex.entity.Each key represents the fully qualified path name of an Assembly or Part in the target CAD model.The apex.entity indicates the entity shown in Apex either from the top level Part or Assembly of the target CAD model. If neither of the "skipUnmodified" or "importFilter" arguments are supplied, all Parts and Assemblies in the target CAD model will be imported - and the Boolean values in the dictionary will be "True" for all Parts and Assemblies. If the "skipUnmodified" argument is "True", Apex will attempt to determine if the target CAD model has previously been imported into this Apex Model, and if it has, will attempt to determine which Parts / Assemblies in the target CAD Model have been modified or added since the last import.Any Parts or Assemblies that are determined to be unchanged since the last import will be skipped during import. The optional "importFilter" argument is a Dictionary with string type keys and Boolean values and has the same form as the dictionary returned by this method.When supplied as an input to this method the Boolean values associated with each Part / Assembly determines whether the Part / Assembly will be imported or ignored.True values will cause the Part / Assembly to be imported and False values will cause it to be ignored. If the optional "preview" argument is True, this method will not complete the import of the CAD model.Please use importGeometryPreview() to get the result of preview.

- `geometryFileNames` — A List of the path qualified file geometry file names

- `sewOnImport` — Optionally "Sew" geometry edges as part of the import operation. Default = False
- `skipUnmodified` — Optional Boolean argument (default = False) that determines whether the system will import all of the Parts and/or Assemblies in the target set of files in geometryFilenames or only the subset that has changed since the last import. If set to True, Apex will examine (recursively) every Part and Assembly in the target set of Geometry files to import and will import only those Parts and Assemblies that it can determine have changed since the last import. To determine which Parts or Assemblies Apex believes have changed or added WITHOUT importing the CAD model, set this argument to True and also se the "preview" argument to True - this will cause the method to return the Dictionary and for each Part/Assembly a Boolean value that indicates whether the Part?assembly would have been imported (if "preview" was omitted or set to False). A True value associated to a Part/Assembly indicates that Apex has determined that the Part/Assembly has changed since the last import and will be re-imported.
- `importFilter` — Optional import filter to control which Parts and Assemblies in the input Assembly will be imported. importFilter is a Dictionary with string keys and Boolean values. Each key contains the fully qualified path name of the Part/Assembly in the imported CAD model and the associated Boolean value indicates whether the associated Part/Assembly should be imported or ignored. Parts/Assemblies with True values will be imported while False values will cause the associated Part/Assembly to be ignored and not imported. If a parent item in the tree (Assembly, sub-Assembly) is ignored (False) then all of its children will be silently ignored, even if they are marked as "True" Although it is possible to construct importFilter manually, it is recommended to execute this method with the "preview" argument set to True and this value set to False. This will cause the method to interrogate the target CAD model and return the Dictionary containing the Part/Assembly structure only. You can then be sure that the dictionary matches the structure in the CAD model. Users can then modify the Boolean values and execute the method again, using the modified dictionary for this argument.
- `preview` — Optional argument that defines whether the content of the target CAD files will be completely imported into Apex or if the method will simply interrogate the structure of the CAD model and return the model structure only. If False (Default) the model contained in the target geometryFileNames will be imported directly to Apex according to the values of the other arguments. If True, this method will not complete the import of the CAD model. Please use importGeometryPreview() to get the result of preview.
- `importReviewMode3dxmlCleanOnImport` — Optional boolean argument to control whether the imported review mode 3dxml file will be "cleaned" on import. The default value of "True" will cause geometry cleaning to be performed during import, setting to False will import the geometry "as-is".
- `importReviewMode3dxmlSplitOnFeatureVertexAngle` — Optional argument used to control the creation of faceted geometry bodies by taking account the feature and vertex angle, the default is True. If it is set as false, then the arguments of "importReviewMode3dxmlFeatureAngle" and "importReviewMode3dxmlVertexAngle" will be ignored.

- `importReviewMode3dxmlVertexAngle` — Optional argument used to control the creation of faceted geometry bodies. Topological geometry vertices will be created between any edges of the 3dxml data that have subtended angles greater than this value. vertexAngle is an Angle quantity and must be defined using the units of Angle from the active script unit system
- `importReviewMode3dxmlDetectMachinedFaces` — This is an optional argument. When on, this triggers an algorithm to search for possible machined faces. When found, these will be split into separate faces. The types of faces that can be found are planar, cylinder, and torus faces. Depending on the smoothness and accuracy of the input tessellation, these will be detected and partitioned into separate faces. The intended use case is a model with mostly organic faces that as some analytical faces machined into it. For models that come primarily from analytical faces, such as STL from CAD or STL from FEM meshes that were applied to CAD, it is better to import as Mesh, then use the facet body tool in Apex to convert to facet bodies and optionally NURBS. It will be ignored if the argument "importReviewMode3dxmlSplitOnFeatureVertexAngle" is set as True.
- `importAttributes` — Optional boolean argument that defines whether the attributes of the target CAD files will be imported into Apex. If False (Default) the attributes in the CAD files will be ignored. If True, the method will import the attributes in the CAD files and convert them as Apex User Attributes after import.

Use the equivalent method on each top Level Part or Asssembly instead or re-organize your model into a singel top level Assembly. The method arguments provide control over import options. Only bulk data entries are imported when this method is called from the Model class - to import Case (and other Marc file sections) use the equivalent method on the Scenario class instead. The method arguments provide control over import options.

- `importHierarchicalFiles` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the imported data is written as a series of hierarchical include files that mirrors the Assembly/Part product structure, or as a single flat file. The default value of "False" causes a single file to be written containing all of the finite element entities within the Assembly to be written.
- `renumberMethod` — An enumeration to control how renumbering of finite element entities is handled if duplicate ID's are detected within the scope of the imported Model Apex supports duplicate ID's for most finite element entities including Nodes and Elements, however most Marc jobs require these ID's to be unique within the scope of the Marc run. This enumeration is used to control how Apex resolves duplicate ID's when models are being imported as Marc files. Two options are provided, "internal" causes the renumbering operation to carried out and persisted in the Apex Model. "import" causes the renumbering operation to be applied ONLY to the imported Marc file and has no impact on the ID's within Apex.

Setting the value of this argument to apex.geometry.STLImportBodyType.Faceted will cause the system to create faceted geometry bodies.
- `featureAngle` — Optional argument used to control the creation of faceted geometry bodies. Topological geometry edges will be created between any faces of the STL data that have subtended angles greater than this value. This argument will be silently ignored if importBodyType is set to Mesh. featureAngle is an Angle quantity and must be defined using the units of Angle from the active script unit system
- `vertexAngle` — Optional argument used to control the creation of faceted geometry bodies. Topological geometry vertices will be created between any edges of the STL data that have subtended angles greater than this value.

The types of faces that can be found are planar, cylinder, and torus faces. Depending on the smoothness and accuracy of the input tessellation, these will be detected and partitioned into separate faces. This only applies to STL imported as facet body. If imported as mesh this is ignored. The intended use case is a model with mostly organic faces that as some analytical faces machined into it. For models that come primarily from analytical faces, such as STL from CAD or STL from FEM meshes that were applied to CAD, it is better to import as Mesh, then use the facet body tool in Apex to convert to facet bodies and optionally NURBS.

Creates and returns a MeshBody in this Part. The method can create all types of meshBodies supported by Apex - PointMesh, CurveMesh, SurfaceMesh, SolidMesh, HexMesh - using the meshType argument. Nodes and Elements can optionally be created during construction of the MeshBody or added to the MeshBody later.

- `meshType` — Defines the type of mesh that will be created using a MeshType enum.
- `name` — An optional name for the mesh. If omitted, the system will define a default mesh name.
- `description` — An optional description for the MeshBody. If omitted, the Description will be left blank.
- `csys` — An optional CoordinateSystem for the Node coordinates.The CoordinateSystem must be Rectangular, Cylindrical or Spherical.If omitted, the coordinate values are assumed to be in the global coordinate system.If supplied, the coordinate values represents coordinates in this CoordinateSystem.NOTE : If a CoordinateSystem is supplied the coordinate values will be transformed from this coordinate system to global. A future release will extend the Node object to support a definition coordinate system thereby allowing the original coordinates to be retained.
- `nodeCoordinates` — A List of floats defining the coordinates of the nodes.The array contains repeated sequences of x, y and z coordinates, one sequence for each node.The number of array entries must be a multiple of 3.The coordinates represent locations in space and have units of Length therefore the values must be defined in the units of Length of the current ScriptUnitsSystem.Node ID's will be assigned by the system.
- `elements` — The elements that will be created and added to the meshBody during construction. If omitted, no elements will be created during MeshBody construction and elements may be added later using methods provided on the MeshBody. elements is a Dictionary with a key type of apex.mesh.ElementTopology and an associated List[Int] value type. Multiple element types may be added to the MeshBody during construction by including multiple key, value pairs in the Dictionary - one for each ElementType. The value associated with each key is List of integers representing the element Node indices. The Node indices are indices into the provided nodeCoordinates List. When elements are defined during meshBody creation, the nodes that they reference must also be defined during creation. The indices are used to define the topology of the element. Multiple elements of the same type are defined within a single dictionary value by providing sequences of element indices. The length of each sequence is dependent on the element type and the total number of indices in the string must be a multiple of the required number of Nodes for the specific element type. Consider for example a linear triangular shell element. The key for this element type will be apex.mesh.ElementType.Tria. Each element has three nodes, therefore the length of the integer sequence in the corresponding Dictionary value will be three and the total number of entries in the value List must be a factor of three. Consider a MeshBody containing three linear triangular shell elements as follows, Tria 1 is defined by Node indices 1, 2, 3 Tria 2 is defined by Node indices 1, 3, 4 Tria 3 is defined by Node indices 4, 3, 5 In this case the value List would be defined as element_node_ids = [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5]

Returns: the MeshBody

This data passes through the solver to the output .h5 file without otherwise impacting the solution and can be used during a subsequent import of the Nastran model to Apex to reconstruct "rich" Apex objects from the "raw" Nastran keywords.
- `writePropertyOnElement` — Optional boolean argument (Default = True) that controls whether the property is written on element entry or it is written as a separated entry in the exported file.
- `exportProperty` — Optional argument to control the way how the property is exported, the default value is "AsDefined", unless one of other two values are given : "Inline" or "External". If "AsDefined" is given, then the property will be exported according to the defined way in Apex, for example : one spring is defined with "Embedded" property, then this spring is exported as CLEAS2; one spring is referring a existed property through "Use property" method, then this spring is exported as CELAS1 and PELAS. If "Inline" is given, the property will be written in the element entry If "External" is given, the property will be written as a separated nastran entry Damper has the same behavior during exporting with different setting for this argument.

Export Geometry from this Part to a file using the supplied CAD format.

- `filename` — Fully qualified name of the file to which the geometry objects will be exported.
- `cadFormat` — defines the format of the CAD file that will be exported using an apex.geometry.CADFormat enumeration.
- `unitSystem` — A string to identify the units to be used during export. Unit support is dependent on the CADFormat of the exported file and not all formats support units.Of the CAD formats currently supported by Apex, only the IGES/STL format supports user defined export units. The support Length unit: m, cm, mm, ft, in If the IGES/STL format is selected, unitSystem will be available. If it is undefined, use the default unitSystem = m. If a value other than one in the above unit is supplied, the method will throw an exception
- `stlMergeCells` — optional Boolean argument (default = True) that controls how multi-cellular solids will be represented in STL files. This argument is only relevant when the cadFormat type is an STL type and is silently ignored for all other formats. When True (Default), all cells in a multi-cellular solid will be merged into a single cell during export by removing all internal Faces. The GeometryBody is unaffected by this operation. When False, all cells in multi-cellular solids will be present in the exported STL file.
- `exportVirtualFaces` — Optional Argument, Default = False, where each virtual faces will be exported as a single face. This only applies to CAD Format Parasolid. The purpose is to export geometry topology that is consistent with native Apex to maintaining associatively with mesh, loads, BCs and other attributes. An attempt will be made to export the virtual faces as NURBS, by replacing the each virtual face with a single NURBS face. If this fails, then a facet body face will be used instead.
- `exportVirtualFaceMethod` — This applies to exportGeometry API only. It controls what is permitted for converting virtual topology to exportable faces with the same topology. This is ignored if exportVirtualFaces is False. If set to NurbsAndFaceted, then the system will try to convert to NURBS, and if that fails, it will then convert the face into a faceted face. If set to NurbsOnly (Default), then it will try to convert each virtual face to NURBS only.

For example:


## `apex.Region`  (extends `Entity`, `IPhysical`, `IUserAttributes`, `IName`, `IOrientation`)
Class used to persist collections of ILocation objects, including Mesh and Geometry sub-entities, with non-volatile names and pathNames. (NOTE: Don't support features of IUserHighLightable in current release, will support in future.) Regions support two critical behaviors, 1. Non-volatile names/pathNames for collections of mesh and geometry sub-entities. Neither Mesh nor Geometry sub-entities provided non-volatile names or IDs. 2. Generative update of the their contents.
Properties: `centroid`, `target`

Methods:

- `addEntities(entities: apex.ILocationCollection) -> None` — Add entities to this Region.
- `addEntity(entity: apex.ILocation) -> None` — Add entity to this Region.
- `getCentroid() -> apex.Coordinate` — returns the centroid of this Region as a Coordinate.
- `getTarget() -> apex.ILocationCollection` — A collection of ILocation objects that represent this Region.
- `removeEntities(entities: apex.ILocationCollection) -> None` — Removes entities from this Region.
- `removeEntity(entity: apex.ILocation) -> None` — Removes an entity from this Region.

Method details:

#### `addEntities(entities: apex.ILocationCollection) -> None`
Add entities to this Region. Entities in the input that are not supported by Region will be silently ignored. Entities in the input that are already referenced by this Region will be silently ignored.

- `entities` — The collection of ILocation entities that will comprise the Region. The following entity types are currently supported, 1. GeometryBody (Solid, Surface, Curve, Point and all specializations thereof) 2. GeometryTopology (Cell, Face, Edge, Vertex) 3. MeshBody (SolidMesh, HexMesh, SurfaceMesh, CurveMesh, PointMesh) 4. Node 5. Element

#### `addEntity(entity: apex.ILocation) -> None`
Add entity to this Region. If the input Entity type is not supported by Region, it will be silently ignored If the input Entity type is already referenced by this Region, it will be silently ignored.

- `entity` — The Entity to add to this Region. The following entity types are currently supported, 1. GeometryBody (Solid, Surface, Curve, Point and all specializations thereof) 2. GeometryTopology (Cell, Face, Edge, Vertex) 3. MeshBody (SolidMesh, HexMesh, SurfaceMesh, CurveMesh, PointMesh) 4. Node 5. Element

#### `getCentroid() -> apex.Coordinate`
returns the centroid of this Region as a Coordinate. If the Region references a single entity, the centroid of this Region is derived directly from the centroid of that single object. If the single object is a type that does not support a centroid property this property will return a None type. If the Region references multiple entities, the centroid of this Region is derived directly from the centroid of the oriented bounding box that encloses the referenced entities.

Returns: returns the centroid of this Region as a Coordinate.

#### `getTarget() -> apex.ILocationCollection`
A collection of ILocation objects that represent this Region. The following entity types are currently supported, 1. GeometryBody (Solid, Surface, Curve, Point and all specializations thereof) 2. GeometryTopology (Cell, Face, Edge, Vertex) 3. MeshBody (SolidMesh, HexMesh, SurfaceMesh, CurveMesh, PointMesh) 4. Node 5. Element.

#### `removeEntities(entities: apex.ILocationCollection) -> None`
Removes entities from this Region. Entities in the input that are not supported by Region will be silently ignored Entities in the input that are not referenced by this Region will be silently ignored.

- `entities` — The collection of ILocation objects to remove from this Region. The following entity types are currently supported, 1. GeometryBody (Solid, Surface, Curve, Point and all specializations thereof) 2. GeometryTopology (Cell, Face, Edge, Vertex) 3. MeshBody (SolidMesh, HexMesh, SurfaceMesh, CurveMesh, PointMesh) 4. Node 5. Element

#### `removeEntity(entity: apex.ILocation) -> None`
Removes an entity from this Region. If the input Entity type is not supported by Region, it will be silently ignored If the input Entity type is not already referenced by this Region, it will be silently ignored.

- `entity` — The Entity to add to this Region. The following entity types are currently supported, 1. GeometryBody (Solid, Surface, Curve, Point and all specializations thereof) 2. GeometryTopology (Cell, Face, Edge, Vertex) 3. MeshBody (SolidMesh, HexMesh, SurfaceMesh, CurveMesh, PointMesh) 4. Node 5. Element
