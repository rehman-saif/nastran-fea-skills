Updates one or more properties of this SolidMesh. All modifiable properties of the SolidMesh are supported as optional arguments and multiple properties may be updated in a single call. Any properties not included in the argument list are unchanged by this method.

- `name` — An optional name for the created mesh. If multiple meshes are created this name will be used for the first mesh created and each subsequent mesh will use this name as a prefix to which a unique integer will be concatenated to ensure name uniqueness. For example with name defined to be 'My Mesh' the first mesh will be named "My Mesh", and any subsequent meshes will be named 'My Mesh 1', 'My mesh 2' etc.
- `meshSize` — An optional mesh size. The mesher will attempt to create tetrahedral elements with lengths equal to this value. Note that existing mesh seeds, short geometry edges, curved geometry or other arguments provided on this method may cause elements sizes smaller or larger than this target to be created. meshSize represents a Length quantity and must be defined in the units of Length in the active script units system.
- `meshType` — THIS ARGUMENT WILL BE DEPRECATED AND WILL BE RMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. This method can only create meshes containing tetrahedral elements therefore this argument is no longer required.
- `elementOrder` — optional enumeration defining the order of the elements to be created for the SolidMesh. apex.mesh.ElementOrder.Quadratic (Default) will cause creation of tetrahedral elements with mid edge nodes apex.mesh.ElementOrder.Linear will cause creation of tetrahedral elements without mid edge nodes
- `refineMeshUsingCurvature` — Optional boolean argument (Default = True) that controls whether the method will locally refine the mesh in regions where the geometry is curved or not. If True (Default) element faces on the surface of the mesh will be refined in areas of geometry curvature to ensure a minimum deviation of the element from the geometry (The amount of deviation enforced is controlled by the elementGeometryDeviationRatio argument). If False, no local refinement will be applied
- `elementGeometryDeviationRatio` — An optional argument (Default = 0.1) defining how much spatial deviation is allowed between the mesh and the geometry in areas of geometry curvature. This quantity is expressed as the ratio of two lengths. The numerator length is the maximum distance from any point on the element edge to the geometry edge. The denominator length is the element edge length. The default value of 0.1 will ensure that the maximum distance between any point on the element edge and the associated geometry edge will be no more than 10% of the element edge length. This argument is ignored unless refineMeshUsingCurvature is enabled.
- `elementMinEdgeLengthRatio` — optional argument (Default = 0.2) that controls the minimum element edge length when curvature based mesh refinement is enabled The quantity represents the ratio of the element edge length to the global element size. The default value of 0.2 will ensure that the curvature refinement algorithm will not create elements with edges that are less than 20% of the global element size. Note that this meshing parameter has priority over the elementGeometryDeviationRatio argument and may cause elements to be created that deviate from the geometry by more than the distance implied by elementGeometryDeviationRatio.
- `autoimprove` — optional boolean argument (Default = True) that controls whether this method will perform additional mesh modification steps after initial meshing to improve the mesh quality. If enabled (True), the initial mesh will be modified to ensure that all elements in the mesh satisfy the following element quality metrics Aspect Ratio Jacobian The values of these element quality metrics form the ???? are used.
- `growFaceMeshSize` — Flag to enable the face mesh growth.
- `faceMeshGrowthRatio` — This property will be a single floating point number between 0 and 1 that defines the size ratio of adjacent elements. A growth factor of 0 is interpreted to mean that no change in size will be supported between adjacent elements. A growth factor of 1 is interpreted to mean that element size may double between adjacent element faces on the free surface of the mesh. A suitable default value will be determined during development of the capability based on testing of representative models.
- `coarsenMeshInternally` — optional boolean argument that controls whether the method will attempt to create elements larger than meshSize in interior regions of the mesh. If True (Default), the method will attempt to create elements with edges longer than meshSize in interior regions of the mesh, away from the free surface. The rate at which element sizes grow with distance from the free surface is controlled by the gradeFactor argument.
- `gradeFactor` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. Please use the equivalent interiorCoarseningFactor instead optional argument (Default = 0.1) that controls how rapidly element sizes will increase from the free surface of the mesh to the interior. This argument is silently ignored unless coarsenMeshInternally is enabled. The value represents the change in element size between adjacent elements in the direction from the free surface of the mesh towards the interior. The default value of 0.1 will cause adjacent elements to be no more than 10% larger then their immediate neighbor.
- `interiorCoarseningFactor` — optional argument (Default = 0.1) that controls how rapidly element sizes will increase from the free surface of the mesh to the interior. This argument is silently ignored unless coarsenMeshInternally is enabled. The value represents the change in element size between adjacent elements in the direction from the free surface of the mesh towards the interior. The default value of 0.1 will cause adjacent elements to be no more than 10% larger then their immediate neighbor.
- `ignoreBadEdges` — optional boolean argument (Default = True) that controls whether or not this method will create element edges on ALL geometry Edges, including very short or poorly shaped edges) or not. If True (Default), the method will ignore very short or poorly shaped geometry edges. NOTE : If the Edge is referenced by a Load or a Constraint or some other simulation attribute it will ALWAYS be meshed, irrespective of the value of this argument to ensure that the Load/Constrain is included in the simulation.
- `collapseShortElementEdges` — optional boolean argument (Default = False) that controls whether or not this method will collapse element edges that are shorter than a predefined minimum length (specified by the collapseElementEdgesShorterThan argument). If False (Default) the mesher will create elements with no lower bound limit on edge length. If True the method will collapse element edges shorter than the associate collapseElementEdgesShorterThan value.
- `collapseElementEdgesShorterThan` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE RMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. Use the equivalent ??? argument instead. an optional argument defining the minimum element edge length that will be created by this method, This argument is silently ignored unless the associated collaspeShortElementEdges argument is enabled (True) collapseElementEdgesShorterThan represents a Length quantity and must be provided in the units of Length in the active script unit system.
- `edgeLengthCollapseLimit` — optional argument defining the minimum element edge length that will be created by this method, This argument is silently ignored unless the associated collaspeShortElementEdges argument is enabled (True) collapseElementEdgesShorterThan represents a Length quantity and must be provided in the units of Length in the active script unit system.
- `createFeatureMeshes` — optional boolean argument (Default = False) that controls whether or not this method will cause creation of feature meshes around identified geometric features. If False (Default), no feature meshes will be created If True, Feature meshes will be created around the set of feature types activated by the argument.
- `featureMeshTypes` — optional argument controlling the types of feature meshes that this method will attempt to create. This argument is silently ignored unless createFeatureMeshes is enabled. featureMeshTypes is List of apex.mesh.FeatureMeshType enumerations. Feature meshes will be created for each apex.mesh.FeatureMeshType included in the List if an underlying geometry feature of that type is identified. If omitted and createFeatureMeshes is enabled, the method will attempt to create Feature meshes for every supported FeatureMeshType.
- `createFeatureMeshOnFillets` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. Please use the optional featuremeshsettings argument instead optional argument (Default - True) controlling whether or not feature meshes will be created around geometry features that are identified as Fillets.

The parameters of the fillet feature mesh will be determined by the Fillet Feature Mesh settings in the active Feature Mesh Settings.
- `createFeatureMeshOnChamfers` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. Please use the optional featuremeshsettings argument instead optional argument (Default - True) controlling whether or not feature meshes will be created around geometry features that are identified as Chamfers.

The parameters of the chamfer feature mesh will be determined by the CHamfer Feature Mesh settings in the active Feature Mesh Settings.
- `createFeatureMeshOnCylinders` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. Please use the optional featuremeshsettings argument instead optional argument (Default - True) controlling whether or not feature meshes will be created around geometry features that are identified as Cylinders. If True (Default) cylinder feature meshes will be created around all geometry faces that are identified as cylinders. The parameters of the cylinder feature mesh will be determined by the Cylinder Feature Mesh settings in the active Feature Mesh Settings.
- `createFeatureMeshOnSemiCylinders` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. Please use the optional featuremeshsettings argument instead optional argument (Default - True) controlling whether or not feature meshes will be created around geometry features that are identified as Semi-clinders. If True (Default) semi-sylinder feature meshes will be created around all geometry faces that are identified as semi-cylinders. The parameters of the semi-cylinder feature mesh will be determined by the Semi-Cylinder Feature Mesh settings in the active Feature Mesh Settings.
- `createFeatureMeshOnWashers` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. Please use the optional featuremeshsettings argument instead optional argument (Default - True) controlling whether or not feature meshes will be created around geometry features that are identified as Washers.

- `createFeatureMeshOnQuadFaces` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. Please use the optional featuremeshsettings argument instead optional argument (Default - True) controlling whether or not feature meshes will be created around geometry features that are identified as Quad Faces. If True, quad face feature meshes will be created around all geometry faces that are identified as quad faces. The parameters of the quad face feature mesh will be determined by the Quad Face Feature Mesh settings in the active Feature Mesh Settings.
- `createLayeredMesh` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. optional argument controlling whether or not a layered mesh will be created in areas of the solid where the wall thickness or "section" is "thin". If True, the method will attempt to create regular layers of elements in sections of the solid geometry model that are identified to be thin. Additional arguments (thinSectionThreshold, numLayers) are provided to control which regions are considered to be thin and the number of element layers crated in these regions.
- `thinSectionThreshold` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. optional argument defining a characteristic thickness to identify thin sections of the solid geometry. Regions of the model with face pairs that are approximately parallel and separated by a distance no greater than this value are considered to represent a thin section and will be targeted for layered meshing thinSectionThreshold represents a Length quantity and must be provided in the units of Length from the active script unit system.
- `numLayers` — THIS ARGUMENT IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE RELEASE. Defines the number of layers of elements to create in areas of the model where the section is thinner than the dimension defined by "thinSectionThreshold".
- `projectMidsideNodesToGeometry` — optional Boolean argument (default = True) that specifies whether the mid-side nodes of higher order solid elements will be projected onto the target Geometry or not. By default (True), the mid-side nodes of all higher order solid elements will be projected onto the target geometry causing the element edges to follow the curvature of the geometry. Setting this argument to False will cause the mid-side nodes to be positioned at the mid-point of a straight line between the two corner nodes.If the target geometry is curved, the mid-side nodes will not lie directly on the geometry.
- `createMinLayers` — This parameter when on, will set the approximate minimum number of layers of the body. The local density of thin areas as define by meshSize/numLayers will be adjusted to facilitate the requested number of layers. Giving a mesh size of 40mm, and numLayers set to 3, then any area thinner than 13.33 will have the mesh size locally adjusted smaller. Since numLayers is a real number, finer adjustments can be made as needed.
- `approximateNumLayers` — default is 2.0. This is an approximate value. it might be required that 2.1 or 2.2 be used to achieve the desired result in all locations. The large the approximate number of layers, the more instable the result is likely to be, so adjustments up or down may be needed.
- `coreType` — Enumeration defining the core type has two types of hex dominant available in the Distene mesher API, and one for just tets. Options are: 1. Tet 2. Hex 3. HexPrismatic.
- `skinType` — Enumeration defining the skin can be auto-generated using quad dominant or tria. This only applies to unmeshed faces of the solid or cell. Ideally, we should use the best quality quad and tria mesh, and to day that is the new Crossfield and Asterisk field meshers.
- `useMeshFlowOptimization` — Enhance mesh flow to improve quality. Options are: True, Enable mesh flow. False, Disable mesh flow.
- `meshFlow` — Enumeration defining what type of MeshFlow to use for the skin surface mesh. Options are: 1, MeshFlow.Grid, Internal pattern forms grid for flat surfaces. 2, MeshFlow.FollowEdges, Internal pattern flows with edges for flat surfaces.

- `meshType` — Enumeration defining what type of elements can be included in the create SurfaceMesh. Options are: 1. SurfaceMeshElementShape.Mixed 2. SurfaceMeshElementShape.Quadrilateral 3. SurfaceMeshElementShape.Triangle
- `meshMethod` — Enumeration defining which mesh algorithm to use to create the SurfaceMesh. Options are: 1. SurfaceMeshMethod.Auto 2. SurfaceMeshMethod.Pave 3. SurfaceMeshMethod.Mapped
- `mappedMeshDominanceLevel` — Value to control how aggressively the algorithm will be in forcing creation of a mapped mesh. Varies from 1 (least aggressive) to 5 (most aggressive). Must be defined if meshMethod is SurfaceMeshMethod.Mapped.
- `elementOrder` — Enumeration defining the order of the elements to be created for the SurfaceMesh Options are: 1. MeshOrder.Linear 2. MeshOrder.Quadratic.
- `meshUsingPrincipalAxes` — DEPRECATION NOTICE: This parameter has been deprecated and we intend to remove it in the next Apex release. Users are advised to transition their code to use the new extended option "useMeshFlowOptimization" as quickly as possible to avoid future problems. It was used to enable/disable the principal axis guided meshing algorithm causing the mesher to attempt to create elements with edges aligned wit the principal axes of the target faces.
- `allQuadBoundary` — Flag to enable All Quad Boundary Mesh option of the surface meshing algorithm.
- `applyTriaReduction` — turns on tria reduction process. This process will attempted to remove tria from a mesh found in specific patterns. Not all triangle elements can be removed without reducing mesh quality too far. This feature is ignored if growFaceMeshSize or refineMeshUsing Curvature is on. In addition, higher order elements are not currently supported. If higher order elements are needed, use reduction first, then switch mesh to higher order by double clicking on the mesh body in the Model Browser, or from API, use update() to change elementOrder.
- `triaReductionStrength` — This parameter, integer 1 to 5, with default set to 2, will control how aggressively triangle elements will be removed. if the input is 0, then no elements will be removed, all values over 5 will behave the same as 5. At each level between 1 and 5, the element size deviation from the specified mesh size, and the allowable quad distortion will be more permissive. The result will be that more tria can be removed the higher the level, but with the consequence of reduced quality mesh.
- `refineMeshUsingCurvature` — Flag to enable the curvature refinement option of the surface meshing algorithm.
- `curvatureType` — Enumeration defining curvature type.
- `elementGeometryDeviationRatio` — Value to control the maximum deviation between and element edge and it's correpsonding geometry edge during curvature refinement. Takes a value between 0.0 and 1.0. *Must be defined if enableCurvatureRefinement is True, otherwise it is ignored.
- `elementMinEdgeLengthRatio` — Value to control the minimum element edge length relative to the global element edge length during curvature refinement. *Must be defined if enableCurvatureRefinement is True, otherwise it is ignored.
- `proximityRefinement` — Flag to enable proximity mesh refinement.
- `growFaceMeshSize` — Flag to enable the face mesh growth.
- `faceMeshGrowthRatio` — This property will be a single floating point number between 0 and 1 that defines the size ratio of adjacent elements. A growth factor of 0 is interpreted to mean that no change in size will be supported between adjacent elements. A growth factor of 1 is interpreted to mean that element size may double between adjacent element faces on the free surface of the mesh. A suitable default value will be determined during development of the capability based on testing of representative models.
- `createFeatureMeshes` — optional boolean argument (Default = False) that controls whether or not this method will cause creation of feature meshes around identified geometric features. If False (Default), no feature meshes will be created If True, Feature meshes will be created around the set of feature types activated by the argument.
- `featureMeshTypes` — optional argument controlling the types of feature meshes that this method will attempt to create. This argument is silently ignored unless createFeatureMeshes is enabled. featureMeshTypes is List of apex.mesh.FeatureMeshType enumerations. Feature meshes will be created for each apex.mesh.FeatureMeshType included in the List if an underlying geometry feature of that type is identified. If omitted and createFeatureMeshes is enabled, the method will attempt to create Feature meshes for every supported FeatureMeshType.
- `createFeatureMeshOnFillets` — Enables the fillet feature mesh option in surface meshing.
- `createFeatureMeshOnChamfers` — Enables the chamfer feature mesh option in surface meshing.
- `createFeatureMeshOnWashers` — Enables the washer feature mesh option in surface meshing.
- `createFeatureMeshOnArbitraryHoles` — optional boolean argument to request the creation of arbitrary hole feature meshes during surface meshing. When enabled, the mesher will create feature meshes around geometry features that are identified as arbitrary holes. The parameters of the arbitrary hole feature mesh will be defined using the values defined in the active FeatureMeshRuleSet. When disabled, no arbitrary hole feature meshes will be created.
- `createFeatureMeshOnQuadFaces` — Enables the four sided face feature mesh option in surface meshing.
- `projectMidsideNodesToGeometry` — optional Boolean argument (default = True) that specifies whether the mid-side nodes of higher order shell elements will be projected onto the target Geometry or not. By default (True), the mid-side nodes of all higher order shell elements will be projected onto the target geometry causing the element edges to follow the curvature of the geometry. Setting this argument to False will cause the mid-side nodes to be positioned at the mid-point of a straight line between the two corner nodes.If the target geometry is curved, the mid-side nodes will not lie directly on the geometry.
- `useMeshFlowOptimization` — Enhance mesh flow to improve quality. Options are: True, Enable mesh flow. False, Disable mesh flow.
- `meshFlow` — Enumeration defining what type of MeshFlow to use in the SurfaceMesh. Options are: 1, MeshFlow.Grid, Internal pattern forms grid for flat surfaces. 2, MeshFlow.FollowEdges, Internal pattern flows with edges for flat surfaces.
