Method details:

#### `dolly(dollyValue: float) -> None`
Moves the camera closer to or away from the focal point.

- `dollyValue` — - a value to change the distance between the camera and the focal point by dividing the camera's distance from the focal point by the given dollyValue. Use a value greater than one to dolly-in toward the focal point, and use a value less than one to dolly-out away from the focal point.

#### `getFocalPoint() -> apex.Coordinate`
Gets the focal point of the camera in global Cartesian coordinates. The coordinates of the focal point must be defined using the units of Length the from the active script unit system When focalPoint is returned from a Camera object. it is always returned as an apex.ILocation (which inherits ILocation). When setting the focalPoint on a Camera object any instance of a class the inherits ILocation, including apex.Coordinate, can be used.

#### `getParallelScale() -> float`
Gets the scale used to determine what size objects in the scene appear on the screen when parallel projection is enabled. This scale is used to set how model (world) coordinates map to screen coordinates and defines the size of the view in world coordinates. Setting this value to the height of the model (model coordinates) will ensure that the entire model can fit height-wise within the view without being cropped. "parallelScale" works as an "inverse scale" — larger numbers produce smaller images. Setting parallelScale to half the height of the model in the current view will cause the model to require twice as much screen height to be fully displayed (it will appear cropped). Setting parallelScale to twice the height of the model in the current view will cause the model to require half as much screen height to be fully displayed and will occupy only half of the available screen height.

#### `getPosition() -> apex.ILocation`
Gets the position of this Camera in global Cartesian coordinates. The coordinates of the Camera position must be defined using the units of Length the from the active script unit system When position is returned from a Camera object. it is always returned as an apex.ILocation (which inherits ILocation).

- `vertical_distance` — The distance that the camera will be moved (in model space coordinates) along its viewUp (vertical) axis Positive values will move the camera in the positive direction of the viewUp axis and negative values in the negative direction distance represents a Length value and must be defined using the units of Length from the active script unit system

The Camera horizontal axis is perpendicular to both the viewUp and directions of projection axes. This method will change both the position and orientation of the Camera, leaving the focal point, distance and parallel scale unchanged

- `azimuth_angle` — angle by which the camera will be rotated about the azimuth at the focal point. angle represents an Angle quantity and must be defined using the unit of Angle from the active Script unit system

Each integer item in this array represents the number of triangles used to define each Face The number of items in each of these two arrays is equal to the number of Faces in the Tessellation and the data is sequenced consistently by Face across each array. The coordinate item has string key "point_indices" with an associated integer array value. Each integer item in this array represents the index of a point in the Tessellation.points array. Example: a Given the topology shown below comprising a single region with two Faces, nine Edges and eight Vertices, faces["ids"] contains the ids for both Faces - [F1, F2] where Fn represents the ID for Face n faces["num_cells"] contains the number of triangles used to define each Face [F1NumTRias, F2NumTRias]where FnNumTrias = the number of triangles required to define the Face "n" faces["point_indices"] contains the indices of the points that define the triangles for each Face in this Tessellation. This array will contain sum(edges["num_cells"] * 3) entries Each Face tessellation is represented in a key, value pair where, 1. key is an integer type and identifies the Face index. The Face index uniquely identifies the Face within this 2D region 2. value is an array of ints defining the connectivity of the Face tessellation. The Face tessellation consists entirely of triangles, each defined by three indices into the points array for this 2D region. The array is a 1D array where the indices of each triangle are defined one after the other [T1V1, T1V2, T1V3, T2V1, T2V2, T2V3, ....] where Tn represents the triangle index in this array and Vn represents the triangle Vertex index. This array will contain three times as many entire as there are triangle in this tessellation
