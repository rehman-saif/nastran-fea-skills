# apex.gendes — classes

Properties are read via `obj.prop` or `obj.getProp()`. Entity-derived
classes have no setters: change them with `obj.update(...)`.

## `apex.gendes.ClearanceRegion`  (extends `Entity`, `IDisplayable`, `ILocation`, `IName`)
ClearanceRegion Class Object when an existing nominal design CAD model is used to represent retained parts and a Boolean operation is used to remove the volumes of the retained parts from the design space. In this situation it is sometimes required to add a 'clearance region" around the volumes of the retained parts to ensure that the retained parts can be assembled onto the consolidate part. In this case, the clearance region actually reduces the design space.
Properties: `location`, `offsetDistance`

Methods:

- `getLocation() -> apex.Coordinate` — getLocation of ClearanceRegion is not supported yet, it will be supported in feature release.
- `getOffsetDistance() -> float` — returns the offsetDistance of this ClearanceRegion.
- `getTargetFaces() -> apex.geometry.FaceCollection` — returns the targetFaces of this ClearanceRegion.
- `setOffsetDistance(offsetDistance: float) -> None` — set the offsetDistance of this ClearanceRegion.
- `update(name: str = "", description: str = "", offsetDistance: float = 0.0, targetFaces: apex.EntityCollection = None) -> None` — it's used to modify the created clearance region.

Method details:

#### `update(name: str = "", description: str = "", offsetDistance: float = 0.0, targetFaces: apex.EntityCollection = None) -> None`
it's used to modify the created clearance region. Either the name, description, offsetDistance, targetFaces can be updated in one update call.

- `name` — the name of the clearance region.
- `description` — the description of the clearance region.
- `offsetDistance` — it's used to defined how much distance the clearance region is.
- `targetFaces` — it's used to defined which target faces user want to select to applied the clearance region.

## `apex.gendes.CompoundInterface`  (extends `Entity`, `IDisplayable`, `IPhysical`, `IName`)
Class compound interface represents an compound interface object in generative design model. Many loads and boundary conditions are directly applied on the model regions, this usually leads to unreasonable optimization shapes. Applying them on the interface will ensure these application regions are well preserved during optimization and the design shape is printable. CompoundInterface is created on connected faces, and system will create the compound interface volume on the connected faces according to user input. The connected faces may be extended by the offsetDistance if user specifies the parameter - this will enlarge the scope of compound interface.

## `apex.gendes.DesignSpace`  (extends `Entity`, `IPhysical`, `IName`, `IDisplayable`, `IUserAttributes`)
