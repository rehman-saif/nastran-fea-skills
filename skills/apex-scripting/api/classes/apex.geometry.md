Edge, Curve, Face, Surface, Cell and Solid. All other entity types will be silently ignored. Curve must lie within this distance of the input entity.tolerance is a length quantity and must be defined using the units of Length defined by the active ScriptUnitSystem.

#### `evaluateCurveParametricCoordinate(u: float) -> apex.geometry.ZResultEvaluateCurveParametricCoordinate`
This method takes a parametric Curve coordinate (u) as input and returns the equivalent 3D cartesian coordinates as a List of Point3D objects. For simple Curves where all of the Edges in the Curve are represented by a single underlying Curve, this method will return a List containing a single Point3D object based on evaluation of the parametric location (u) on the single underlying Curve. For more complex Curves, where the Edges in the Curve are represented by multiple underlying Curves, current Apex version will throw and exception. This method will be extended in a future Apex release as follows : The method will return one Point3D object per underlying Curve - strictly one point for each underlying Curve for which the input parametric coordinate is valid. Each Point3D location that is returned will have an accompanying ID that identifies the Underlying Curve. This ID cannot be used to access the underlying Curve but is intended to help users understand which coordinates can be reasonably compared - comparing parametric coordinates that are extracted from different underlying Curves should be performed with caution.

- `u` — The value of the parametric "u" coordinate

Returns: Result object

#### `evaluateOrientationCurveParametricCoordinate(u: float) -> apex.Orientation`
This method takes a 1D parametric coordinate (u) as input and returns the default Orientation at that position on the Curve.

- `u` — the 1D parametric coordinate (u) that defines the location on the Curve where the orientation will be evaluated

Returns: Result object

For simple Curves where all of the Edges in the Curve are represented by a single underlying Curve, this method will return the Orientation object based on evaluation of the orientation at the parametric location (u) on the single underlying Curve.For more complex Curves, where the Edges in the Curve are represented by MULTIPLE underlying Curves, current Apex versions will raise an exception.

#### `evaluatePointOnCurve(point: apex.ILocation) -> apex.geometry.ZResultEvaluatePointOnCurve`
This method takes a point in space (as a Point3D object) as input and returns a result object containing the closest point on the Curve as a float value representing the Curve parametric location (u). Apex Curves compose one or more Edges and Edges are bounded by Vertices. Each Edge is actually a region of an underlying Curve defined by one or more trimming vertices where the trimming vertices are the vertices of the Apex Curve. Simple Curves may be represented by single or multiple Edges where all of the Edges are regions of the same underlying Curve. In more complex Curves, the Curves that make up the single Apex Curve may actually be regions of multiple different underlying Curves. The underlying Curves are not visible to the user - the Apex Curve manages the Edges and presents the collection of Edges as a single Apex Curve with multiple contiguous Edges. Apex supports the concept of parametric locations on Curves and Edges. In both cases, the parametric location is actually the parametric location on the underlying Curve. For a point on a single Edge, or for a Curve that has just a single underling Curve, parametric coordinates are relatively straightforward. The range of the parametric coordinate (u) can be determined and the spatial coordinate (x, y, z) can be uniquely calculated for an given parametric location. Note that parametric locations outside of the parametric range of the Curve or Edge do not map to spatial coordinates, and even some parametric coordinates that lie within the parametric coordinate range may not map to real spatial coordinates. It should be noted that the parametric location that is returned by this method is actually the parametric location of the input point on the underlying Curve. In current versions of Apex, this method does not support evaluation of Curves that are supported by multiple underlying Curves and the method will throw an exception in such cases. A future release of Apex will extend this method to support complex Curves as follows: For Apex Curves that are represented by multiple underlying Surfaces, a series of evaluations using this method, each with different input spatial locations, will each return a single parametric location, however those parametric locations may be based on different underlying Curves. If you will be using this method to evaluate relative locations of objects based on the magnitude of a parametric location, you will be required to check that the parametric locations you are comparing are based on the same underlying Curve otherwise you may experience unexpected outcomes. For this reason, the method will return both the ID of the underlying Curve AND the parametric location. The underlying Curve cannot be accessed using the scripting API and the ID that is returned should only be used for comparison with ID's from other underlying Curves.

- `point` — a point in space (as a Point3D object)

Returns: Result object

#### `evaluateTangent(location: apex.ILocation) -> apex.construct.Vector3D`
Evaluates the tangent to this Curve at the input location and returns it as a Vector3D.

Returns: the tangent to the Curve at the input location as a Vector3D

#### `findCoincidentObjects(target: EntityCollection = EntityCollection(), tolerance: float = 0.001) -> EntityCollection`
Finds all Vertices, Points, Edges and Curves that are coincident with this Curve, within the supplied tolerance, and returns them in an EntityCollection.

- `target` — An optional collection of entities that will be checked for coincidence with this Curve. Valid entity types for target include Curve, Edge, Point and Vertex - all other entity types will be silently ignored.
- `tolerance` — The tolerance that will be used to determine if an object is coincident with this Curve.

Returns: entities coincident with Curve

When possible the method will return only the "highest topology" objects that are coincident with this Curve. For example, if an entire Curve is coincident with this Curve only the Curve will be returned and its constituent Edges and Vertices will be omitted, even though they are coincident by definition.If no entities are coincident with this Curve the method will return an empty EntityCollection.This method is designed to find all objects that are coincident with this Curve. Coincidence is defined to exist if all locations on an object are fully enclosed by this Curve. A location is said to be enclosed by the Curve if the shortest distance between it and this Curve is less than the specified tolerance. If any location on the object is not enclosed by this Curve, the object is considered to be not coincident with this Curve.Note that an object does not need to fill the entire space associated with this Curve to be considered coincident - it need only occupy a subset of the space of this Curve to be considered coincident.Note - although this method has been implemented to be highly performant, the performance is dependent on the number of Vertices, Points, Edges and Curves in the Model and for large models the computational cost and elapsed time may be significant.To improve performance use the optional target argument to supply an explicit collection of objects to check. Performance of this method is proportional to the number of objects that will be checked for coincidence so when possible it is recommended to provide this collection. Curve, all locations on the object must lie within this distance of this Curve.tolerance is a length quantity and must be defined using the units of Length defined by the active ScriptUnitSystem.

The location of a geometry Curve is defined to be at the midpoint of the Curve. For curves without branches the midpoint is defined to be the location on the curve where the lengths of the curve segments on either side are equal. For curves with branches, the location is defined to be the centroid of the Curve

#### `getMassCenterNominal() -> apex.Coordinate`
get the center of mass on this curve as an apex.Coordinate object.

Returns: the mass center of the Curve

The center of mass is a spatial location and will be returned using the units of Length that is defined in the active scripting unit system.The center of mass is calculated assuming a constant distribution of density throughout the Curve and is therefore independent of the actual density value.

#### `getMassNominal(density: float = 1.0) -> float`
get the nominal mass on this curve.

- `density` — The density of the Curve.

Returns: the mass nominal of the Curve

This method returns a value that represents a Mass quantity and uses the unit of Mass that is defined in the active scripting unit system.The calculation of the mass of a curve requires both a density and a length.The density may be supplied as an input argument and if omitted a value of 1.0 will be used.The length is determined directly from the Curve.

#### `getMidPoint() -> apex.Coordinate`
The location of the midPoint of the Curve.

Returns: the curve midPoint

The midPoint of a Curve is the location on the Curve where, if the Curve was split, both halves would be of equal lenght.

#### `getOrientation() -> apex.Orientation`

Returns: the Curve orientation

The orientation of a Curve is calculated as follows,The x axis of the Orientation is tangent to the Curve at the midpoint of the Curve. The tangent direction follows the direction of increasing Edge parametric value - from low to high u for the Edge that contains the midpoint.The z axis of the Orientation is parallel to the binormal of the Curve at the midpoint of the Curve and follows the Face outward normal

#### `getParametricRange() -> {str:float}`
The range of the parametric space coordinates used by the Curve, Apex Curves compose one or more Edges and Edges are bounded by Vertices. Each Edge is actually a region of an underlying Curve defined by one or more trimming vertices where the trimming vertices are the vertices of the Curve that is being queried. Simple Curves may be represented by single or multiple Edges where all of the Edges are regions of the same underlying Curve. In more complex Curves, the Edges that make up the single Apex Curve may actually be regions of multiple different underlying Curves. The underlying Curves are not visible to the user - the Apex Curve manages the Edges and presents the collection of Edges as a single Apex Curve with multiple Edges. Apex supports the concept of parametric ranges on both Curves and Edges. In both cases the parametric range is actually the parametric range of the underlying trimmed Curve. For a single Edge, or for a Curve that has just a single underling Curve, parametric coordinate ranges are relatively straightforward. The range of the parametric coordinate can be determined from the single, trimmed underlying Curve. For Apex Curves that are defined by multiple underlying Curves, multiple parametric ranges exist and this attribute represents the maximum and minimum parametric coordinates across all of the trimmed underlying Curves - so the individual uStart and uEnd values returned here may occur on different underlying Curves.

Returns: parametric range

#### `getPrincipalInertiaFrameNominal() -> apex.construct.CoordinateSystem`
get the principal inertia frame on this curve as a rectangular CoordinateSystem.

Returns: the principal inertia frame of the Curve

Export Geometry from this GeometryBody to a file using the supplied CAD format.

- `filename` — Fully qualified name of the file to which the geometry objects will be exported.
- `cadFormat` — defines the format of the CAD file that will be exported using an apex.geometry.CADFormat enumeration.
- `unitSystem` — A string to identify the units to be used during export. Unit support is dependent on the CADFormat of the exported file and not all formats support units. Of the CAD formats currently supported by Apex, only the IGES format supports user defined export units. The table below shows each of the supported unit systems and associated unitSystem values for IGES export CAD Format - Length unit - unitSystem value IGES Kilometer km Meter m Centimeter cm Millimeter mm Micrometer um Mile mile Foot ft Inch in Milliinch mi Microinch ui If the IGES format is selected, unitSystem must be provided. If a value other than one in the above table is supplied, the method will throw an exception
- `stlMergeCells` — optional Boolean argument (default = True) that controls how multi-cellular solids will be represented in STL files. This argument is only relevant when the cadFormat type is an STL type and is silently ignored for all other formats. When True (Default), all cells in a multi-cellular solid will be merged into a single cell during export by removing all internal Faces. The GeometryBody is unaffected by this operation. When False, all cells in multi-cellular solids will be present in the exported STL file.
- `exportVirtualFaces` — Optional Argument, Default = False, where each virtual faces will be exported as a single face. This only applies to CAD Format Parasolid. The purpose is to export geometry topology that is consistent with native Apex to maintaining associatively with mesh, loads, BCs and other attributes. An attempt will be made to export the virtual faces as NURBS, by replacing the each virtual face with a single NURBS face. If this fails, then a facet body face will be used instead.
- `exportVirtualFaceMethod` — This applies to exportGeometry API only. It controls what is permitted for converting virtual topology to exportable faces with the same topology. This is ignored if exportVirtualFaces is False. If set to NurbsAndFaceted, then the system will try to convert to NURBS, and if that fails, it will then convert the face into a faceted face. If set to NurbsOnly (Default), then it will try to convert each virtual face to NURBS only.
- `exportBodyPositionInLocal` — Optional Boolean argument to export the geometry body in local position based the reference system of the body and parent part. By default, it is false. The system will export the geometry body position in global.

Returns: coincident entities

Returns an EntityCollection containing the subset of the input entities with which this Surface is coincident.If this Surface is not coincident with any of the input entities the method will return an empty EntityCollection.This method is designed to determine if this Surface is coincident with other objects. Coincidence is defined to exist if all locations on the Face is fully enclosed by the other object. A location is said to be enclosed by the other object if the shortest distance between it and the other object is less than the specified tolerance. If any location on this Surface is not enclosed by the other object it is considered to be not coincident with the object.Note that this Surface does not need to fill the entire space associated with the other object to be coincident - it need only occupy a subset of the space of the other object to be considered coincident. Face, Surface, Cell and Solid. All other entity types will be silently ignored. Surface must lie within this distance of the input entity.tolerance is a length quantity and must be defined using the units of Length defined by the active ScriptUnitSystem.

#### `evaluateOrientationSurfaceParametricCoordinate(u: float, v: float) -> apex.Orientation`
This method takes a 2D parametric coordinate (u, v) as input and returns the default Orientation at that position on the Surface.

- `u` — the 'u' component of the 2D parametric coordinate (u, v) that defines the location on the Surface where the orientation will be evaluated
- `v` — the 'v' component of the 2D parametric coordinate (u, v) that defines the location on the Surface where the orientation will be evaluated

Returns: Result object

For simple Surfaces, where all of the Faces in the Surface are represented by a single underlying Surface, this method will return the orientation at the parametric location (u) on the single underlying Surface.For more complex Surfaces, where the Faces in the Surfaces are represented by MULTIPLE underlying Surfaces, Apex will raise an exception.

#### `evaluatePointOnSurface(point: apex.ILocation) -> apex.geometry.ZResultEvaluatePointOnSurface`
This method takes a point in space (as a Point3D object) as input and returns a result object containing the closest point on the Surface as a ParametricCoordinate2D. Apex Surfaces compose one or more Faces and Faces are bounded by Edges. Each Face is actually a region of an underlying Surface defined by one or more trimming loops where the trimming loops are the Edges of the Face. Simple Surfaces may be represented by single or multiple Faces where all of the Faces are regions of the same underlying Surface. In more complex Surfaces, the Faces that make up the single Apex Surface may actually be regions of multiple different underlying Surfaces. The underlying Surfaces are not visible to the user - the Apex Surface manages the Faces and presents the collection of faces as a single Apex Surface with multiple Faces. Apex supports the concept of parametric locations on Surfaces and Faces. In both cases, the parametric location is actually the parametric location on the underlying Surface. For a single Face, or for a Surface that has just a single underling Surface, parametric coordinates are relatively straightforward. The range of each parametric coordinate (u, v) can be determined and the spatial coordinate (x, y, z) can be uniquely calculated for an given parametric location. Note that parametric locations outside of the parametric range of the Surface or Face do not map to spatial coordinates, and even some parametric coordinates that lie within the parametric coordinate range may not map to real spatial coordinates - consider example a Face or Surface with a hole, or that is irregular in shape. AND the ID of the underlying Surface. See the below text for further explanation of the underlying Surface. It should be noted that the parametric location that is returned by this method is actually the parametric location of the input point on the underlying Surface. In current versions of Apex, this method only supports simple Apex Surfaces (as defined above) and the method will throw an exception if the Apex Surface is complex. A future release of Apex will extend this method to support complex Surfaces as follows: For Apex Surfaces that are represented by multiple underlying Surfaces, a series of evaluations using this method, each with different input spatial locations, will each return a single parametric location, however those parametric locations may be based on different underlying Surfaces. If you will be using this method to evaluate relative locations of objects based on the magnitude of a parametric location, you will be advised to check that the parametric locations you are comparing are based on the same underlying Surface, otherwise you may experience unexpected outcomes. For this reason, in a future Apex version, the method will return both the ID of the underlying Surface AND the parametric location. The underlying Surface cannot be accessed using the scripting API and the ID that is returned should only be used for comparison with ID's from other underlying Surfaces.

- `point` — a point in space (as a Point3D object)

Returns: Result object

#### `evaluateSurfaceNormal(location: apex.ILocation) -> apex.construct.Vector3D`
evaluateSurfaceNormal

- `location` — to find normal

Returns: normal vector

#### `evaluateSurfaceParametricCoordinate(u: float, v: float) -> apex.geometry.ZResultEvaluateSurfaceParametricCoordinate`
This method takes a parametric Surface coordinate (u, v) as input and returns the equivalent 3D cartesian coordinates as a List of Point3D objects. For simple Surfaces where all of the Faces in the Surface are represented by a single underlying Surface, this method will return a List containing a single Point3D object based on evaluation of the parametric location (u, v) on the single underlying Surface. For more complex Surfaces, where the Faces in the Surface are represented by multiple underlying Surfaces, Apex will currently throw an exception. Future releases of Apex will extend this method as follows: The method will return one Point3D object per underlying Surface - strictly one point for each underlying Surface for which the input parametric coordinate is valid. Each Point3D location that is returned will have an accompanying "underlying surface ID" that represents the ID of the Underlying Surface. This ID will not be used to access the underlying Surface but will be intended to help users understand which coordinates can be reasonably compared - comparing parametric coordinates that are extracted from different underlying surfaces should be performed with caution.

- `u` — The value of the parametric "u" coordinate
- `v` — The value of the parametric "v" coordinate

Returns: Result object

#### `findCoincidentObjects(target: EntityCollection = EntityCollection(), tolerance: float = 0.001) -> EntityCollection`

- `target` — An optional collection of entities that will be checked for coincidence with this Surface. Valid entity types for target include Surface, Face, Curve, Edge, Point and Vertex - all other entity types will be silently ignored.
- `tolerance` — The tolerance that will be used to determine if an object is coincident with this Surface.

Returns: entities coincident with Surface

If no entities are coincident with this Surface the method will return an empty EntityCollection.When possible the method will return only the "highest topology" objects that are coincident with this Surface. For example, if an entire Surface is coincident with this Surface only the Surface will be returned and its constituent Faces, Edges and Vertices will be omitted, even though they are coincident by definition.This method is designed to find all objects that are coincident with this Surface. Coincidence is defined to exist if all locations on an object are fully enclosed by this Surface. A location is said to be enclosed by the Surface if the shortest distance between it and this Surface is less than the specified tolerance. If any location on the object is not enclosed by this Surface, the object is considered to be not coincident with this Surface.Note that an object does not need to fill the entire space associated with this Surface to be considered coincident - it need only occupy a subset of the space of this Surface to be considered coincident.Note - although this method has been implemented to be highly performant, the performance is dependent on the number of Vertices, Points, Edges, Curves, Faces and Surfaces in the Model and for large models the computational cost and elapsed time may be significant.To improve performance use the optional target argument to supply an explicit collection of objects to check. Performance of this method is proportional to the number of objects that will be checked for coincidence so when possible it is recommended to provide this collection. Surface, all locations on the object must lie within this distance of this Surface.tolerance is a length quantity and must be defined using the units of Length defined by the active ScriptUnitSystem.

#### `getParametricRange() -> {str:float}`
The range of the parametric space coordinates used by the Surface, Apex Surfaces compose one or more Faces bounded by Edges. Each Face is actually a region of an underlying Surface defined by one or more trimming loops where the trimming loops are the Edges of the Face. Simple Surfaces may be represented by single or multiple Faces where all of the Faces are regions of the same underlying Surface. In more complex Surfaces, the Faces that make up the single Apex Surface may actually be regions of multiple different underlying Surfaces. The underlying Surfaces are not visible to the user - the Apex Surface manages the Faces and presents the collection of faces as a single Apex Surface with multiple Faces. Apex supports the concept of parametric locations on Surfaces and Faces. In both cases the parametric location is actually the parametric location of the underlying Surface. For a single Face, or for a Surface that has just a single underling Surface, parametric coordinate ranges are relatively straightforward. The range of each parametric coordinate (u, v) can be determined from the single, trimmed underlying Surface. For Apex Surfaces that are defined by multiple underlying Surfaces, multiple parametric ranges exist and this attribute represents the maximum and minimum parametric coordinates across all of the trimmed underlying Surfaces - so the individual uStart, uEnd,, vStart and vEnd values returned here may occur on different underlying Surfaces.

Returns: parametric range

Returns: the nominal principal inertia tensor of mass of the Surface

The returned Dictionary includes keys of type string and values of type float.The inertia tensor is returned using float values and uses the unit of Moment of Inertia (Mass x Length^2) that is defined in the active scripting unit system.The following keys represents the components of the inertia tensor - "ixx", "ixy", "ixz", "iyx", "iyy", "iyz", "izx", "izy", "izz".The calculation of the principal inertia tensor requires definition of the distribution of mass throughout the Surface and this is calculated based on the supplied "density" argument. A default density of "1.0" is supplied if this argument is omitted.

#### `getTessellation() -> apex.display.Tessellation2D`
returns the tessellation for this Surface as a Tesselation2D. The Tesselation2D includes the tessellation for all Faces, Edges and Vertices in this Surface as triangles, lines and points and includes the association between each tessellation and the Face, Edge and Vertex of this Surface that it represents.

## `apex.geometry.ZResultEvaluateCurveParametricCoordinate`
Result object for the Curve.evaluateCurveParametricCoordinate() method. Simple Apex Curves may have one or more Edges and be supported by a single underlying Curve. In this case, the single underlying Curve will be used to evaluate the input parametric coordinate and a single location in 3D space will be returned as a Point3D in the 'points' property of this result object. For more complex Apex Curves, multiple underlying Curves may exist and in current releases of Apex this will cause the method to throw an exception. In a future Apex release, the parametric coordinate will be evaluated using each underlying Curve and one location in 3D space will be returned for each underlying Curve. If the input parametric coordinate is outside of the parametric range of any underlying Curve, no 3D space location will be calculated. This result object provides access to a List of locations that evaluate from the input parametric coordinates and a corresponding List of Curve ID's representing the ID of the underlying Curve from which the corresponding location was evaluated. Underlying Curves are not accessible to Apex and the Curve ID is intended to be used only to compare with other Curve ID's within the same Apex Curve.
Properties: `points`

Methods:

- `getPoints() -> apex.ILocationCollection` — The location(s) in 3D Space of the input Curve parametric coordinates as a List of apex.construct.Point3D.

For simple Curves with a single underlying Curve the List will contain a single Point3D corresponding to the input parametric coordinates. For more complex Curves that have multiple underlying Curves, the parametric coordinate is evaluated on each underlying Curve and, if the parametric coordinate exists on the underlying Curve, a Point3D will be returned. The IDs of the underlying Curves that were used to generate these Point3D's are available in the "curveIDs" List.

## `apex.geometry.ZResultEvaluatePointOnCurve`
A result object that holds the Curve parametric coordinate associated with the input location. For simple Curve with a single underlying Curve the input location will be evaluated against the single underlying Curve and the parametric coordinates of the location on that Curve will be returned. No matter what valid location is provided, the parametric coordinates will always be evaluated using the same single underlying Curve For more complex Curves that have multiple underlying Curves, the same basic approach defined for simple Curves is used, but in this case, the parametric coordinates that are returned may be based on different underlying Curves depending on the actual input location. Comparing parametric coordinates for purposes of sorting etc. is only valid if the parametric coordinates derive form the same underlying Curve. In a future release of Apex, this result object will provide access to both the parametric Curve coordinate associated with the input point AND the ID of the underlying Curve from which it is derived. The underlying Curves will not be accessible to users and the provided ID is designed only to be used for comparison with other underlying Curve ID's from the same Apex Curve In the current release of Apex this method will throw an exception if the Apex Curve relies on more than a single underlying Curve.
Properties: `parametricCoordinates`

Methods:

- `getParametricCoordinates() -> [float]` — The parametric coordinates of input point as a floating point value representing the parametric location on the Curve.

Method details:

#### `getParametricCoordinates() -> [float]`

Note that this coordinate is extracted from underlying Curves of the Apex Curve that is being evaluated. If the Apex Curve is composed of multiple underlying Curves a location on the Apex Curve will map to just one of them and different Apex Curve locations may map to different underlying Curves. A future release of Apex will return the ID of the underlying Curve in this result object alongside the parametric coordinate - this will enable users to validate whether two parametric coordinates returned from different Apex Curve locations are derived from the same underlying Curve or not and use this information to determine whether comparison is meaningful.

No matter what valid location is provided, the parametric coordinates will always be evaluated using the same single underlying Surface For more complex Surfaces that have multiple underlying Surfaces, the same basic approach defined for simple Surfaces is used, but in this case, the parametric coordinates that are returned may be based on different underlying Surfaces depending on the actual input location. Comparing parametric coordinates for purposes of sorting etc. is only valid if the parametric coordinates derive form the same underlying Surface. In a future release of Apex, this result object will provide access to both the parametric surface coordinate associated with the input point AND the ID of the underlying Surface from which it is derived. The underlying Surfaces will not be accessible to users and the provided ID is designed only to be used for comparison with other underlying Surface ID's from the same Apex Surface In the current release of Apex this method will throw an exception if the Apex Surface relies on more than a single underlying Surface.

A future release of Apex will return the ID of the underlying surface in this result object alongside the parametric coordinate - this will enable users to validate whether two parametric coordinates returned from different Apex Surface locations are derived from the same underlying Surface or not and use this information to determine whether comparison is meaningful.


## `apex.geometry.ZResultEvaluateSurfaceParametricCoordinate`

A future release of Apex will support evaluation of surface parametric coordinates on complex Surfaces by evaluating the input parametric coordinate using each underlying Surface and returning one location in 3D space for each underlying Surface. (If the input parametric coordinate is outside of the parametric range of any underlying Surface, no 3D space location will be calculated.) In a future Apex release this result object provide access not only to the single Point3D associated with a valid Surface parametric coordinate, but to a List of locations that evaluate from the input parametric coordinates and a corresponding List of Surface ID's representing the ID of the underlying Surface from which the corresponding location was evaluated.
