## `apex.datavis.LoadSummationPlot`  (extends `Entity`)
LoadSummationPlot is used to display the summation of forces and moments about a point in space. Finite element simulations frequently generate fields of forces and moments at the nodes and/or elements of the meshes that are used to represent the mechanical system that is being studied. In many cases, this distribution of forces and moments (as well as stresses, strains and other quantities of interest) can be used to assess how a proposed design transmits the applied loads throughout the structure. However, there are other engineering cases where this field of forces and moments is inappropriate and the engineer needs to know the total force and/or moment that is being transmitted by or applied to the structure. The LoadSummationPlot presents both the field distribution of forces and moments and the results force/moment arising from this field at a user defined location and orientation in space. The LoadSummationPlot can be used to display free body diagram information - the equivalent force and moment that would need to be applied at a location in space to bring a partial structure into equilibrium. It can also be used to display cross section force sensor output.

Method details:

#### `getColorMap() -> apex.post.ColorMap`
Returns the ColorMap for this LoadSummationPlot. If the color by components, returns None.

#### `getVectorDisplayAnchorStyle() -> apex.datavis.VectorDisplayAnchorStyle`

## `apex.datavis.XSectionForceSensorPlot`  (extends `LoadSummationPlot`)
XSectionForceSensorPlot is used to display the summation of forces and moments from one or more XSectionForceSensors or a single XSectionForceSensorArray. This class specializes the generic LoadSummationPlot specifically for use with XSectionForceSensors by defining the input fields of discrete forces and moments in terms of XSectionForceSensors or XSectionForceSensorArrays plus a static loadEvent. A XSectionForceSensor defines a plane in space and a target region of the Mechanical System (which can be the entire Mechanical System or a subset of that system). Each element in the target region that is intersected by the plane contributes a point force/moment derived from the internal forces acting within the cut element. This plot displays the intersected elements and their associated point forces and moments as well as the summation of the forces and moments about a point in space. The summed forces and moments can be calculated (dynamically) at any point in space, resolved into any user supplied axis system and displayed on the plot.
