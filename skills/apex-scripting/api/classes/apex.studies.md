## `apex.studies.Event`  (extends `Entity`, `IName`, `IUserAttributes`)
An Event defines a combination of constraints and LoadReps that are applied during the simulation of a Step. The combination of LoadReps and Constraints in an Event is intended to represent some design operating condition that the Design will experience. The state of the Mechanical System at the end of a Step is caused by the application of the LoadReps and Constraints to the MechanicalSystem during the Step, causing the initial state of the system to change.
Properties: `constraints`, `loads`, `resultsDataAvailable`

#### `getCommand(commandName: str) -> ScenarioCommand`
> **Fails silently at runtime (Apex 2024.1):** On a `SubcaseNastran`, `getCommand(commandName="LOAD").setValue(n)` reads back correctly in the same script but is gone by the next script, so the exported subcase has no `LOAD =`. Calling `setCommand` before `setValue` does not keep it either. Seen through a remote bridge that runs each script as a separate call; not yet reproduced in the Apex script editor. Output requests are not subcase commands: `getCommand(commandName="DISPLACEMENT")` (also `STRESS`, `SPCFORCES`) raises `Command 'DISPLACEMENT' is UNSUPPORTED`. **Instead:** `cmd = subcase.getCommand(commandName="LOAD"); cmd.setValue(load.id); subcase.setCommand(commandName="LOAD", activate=True)`, in that order, then read the value back in a later script or in the exported deck.

#### `setCommand(commandName: str, activate: bool) -> None`
> **Runtime behaviour (Apex 2024.1):** `setCommand(commandName=..., activate=True)` called after `getCommand(...).setValue(...)` is what made a subcase case control value persist. `commandName` is the bare command name: `"LOAD = 2"` raises `Command 'LOAD = 2' is UNSUPPORTED`. **Instead:** See `LoadCaseItem.getCommand` for the order.
Sets the command provided in the argument on this LoadCaseItem. If the command is not applicable to this LoadCase Item the method will raise an exception.

Method arguments provide control over export options.

- `filename` — The path qualified name of the file that will be exported.
- `unitSystem` — The name of a consistent unit system to use when exporting Nastran files, for example "mm-kg-s-N", "in-slinch-s-lbf".

"export" causes the renumbering operation to be applied ONLY to the exported Nastran file and has no impact on the ID's within Apex.
- `exportAbstractions` — Optional boolean argument (Default = False) that controls whether the exported file will include Nastran ABSTRCT and/or NAMVAL keywords that preserve Apex specific data, not directly support by Nastran, within the Nastran file. This data passes through the solver to the output .h5 file without otherwise impacting the solution and can be used during a subsequent import of the Nastran model to Apex to reconstruct "rich" Apex objects from the "raw" Nastran keywords.
- `writePropertyOnElement` — Optional boolean argument (Default = True) that controls whether the property is written on element entry or it is written as a separated entry in the exported file.
- `exportProperty` — Optional argument to control the way how the property is exported, the default value is "AsDefined", unless one of other two values are given : "Inline" or "External". If "AsDefined" is given, then the property will be exported according to the defined way in Apex, for example : one spring is defined with "Embedded" property, then this spring is exported as CLEAS2; one spring is referring a existed property through "Use property" method, then this spring is exported as CELAS1 and PELAS. If "Inline" is given, the property will be written in the element entry If "External" is given, the property will be written as a separated nastran entry Damper has the same behavior during exporting with different setting for this argument.

Exports the ScenarioNastran to a Nastran file. All objects composed or referenced by the Scenario that can be mapped to Nastran keywords will be exported including the Scenario Model Rep, Events (Loads, Constraints, Initial Conditions), Simulation Settings and Output Requests. Method arguments provide control over export options.

- `filename` — The path qualified name of the file that will be exported.
- `unitSystem` — The name of a consistent unit system to use when exporting Nastran files, for example "mm-kg-s-N", "in-slinch-s-lbf".

- `exportHierarchicalFiles` — A Boolean quantity to control whether the exported data is written as a series of hierarchical include files that mirrors the Assembly/Part product structure, or as a single Flat file. The default for this argument is "False" - causing a single Flat file containing the entire model (matching the scope of the export) to be written.

This data passes through the solver to the output .h5 file without otherwise impacting the solution and can be used during a subsequent import of the Nastran model to Apex to reconstruct "rich" Apex objects from the "raw" Nastran keywords.
- `writePropertyOnElement` — Optional boolean argument (Default = True) that controls whether the property is written on element entry or it is written as a separated entry in the exported file.
- `exportProperty` — Optional argument to control the way how the property is exported, the default value is "AsDefined", unless one of other two values are given : "Inline" or "External". If "AsDefined" is given, then the property will be exported according to the defined way in Apex, for example : one spring is defined with "Embedded" property, then this spring is exported as CLEAS2; one spring is referring a existed property through "Use property" method, then this spring is exported as CELAS1 and PELAS. If "Inline" is given, the property will be written in the element entry If "External" is given, the property will be written as a separated nastran entry Damper has the same behavior during exporting with different setting for this argument.

The key is the event name and the value is a float value, for example frequencyConstraintEvent = {"Event 1": 100.0, "Event 2": 126.00}. The events applied with frequencyConstraintEvent will ignore the value from frequencyConstraintGlobal since the latter is a default settings. The frequency constraint only makes sense for the events with at least one displacement constraint and without any loads. The frequency constraint sets a minimum frequency target for the 1st normal mode frequency of the design target.

#### `getFrequencyConstraintGlobal() -> float`
a float value to define the frequency constraint applied to the scenario - all events in this scenario will have the same frequency constraint if the frequency constraint of the event is not set. The frequency constraint only makes sense for the events with at least one displacement constraint and without any loads. The frequency constraint sets a minimum frequency target for the 1st normal mode frequency of the design target.

#### `getKeepConstraintRegions() -> [str]`
The argument defines a list constraint objects which application regions to be kept during optimization by name. If it is empty, the constraint application regions may be removed during optimization. If constraint objects are set through the argument, the solver will keep the constraint application regions during optimization. If the constraint objects setting through the argument are not associated to environment of the scenario, the system will give an error.

#### `getKeepInterfaceRegions() -> [str]`
The argument defines a list interfaces objects to be kept during optimization by name. If it is empty or undefined, the interface regions may be removed during optimization. If the interface objects are set through the argument, the solver will keep the interface regions during optimization. If the interface setting through the argument are not associated to the model rep, the system will give an error.

#### `getKeepLoadRegions() -> [str]`
The argument defines a list load objects which application regions to be kept during optimization by name. If it is empty, the load's application regions may be removed during optimization.

#### `getShapeQuality() -> ShapeQuality`
Enumeration argument to control the quality of the shape that will be generated. Use apex.gendes.ShapeQuality.Preview for a rapid, coarse grained simulation that will provide a non-optimal, but representative shape. This setting is normally used when first setting up a new simulation to ensure that all other settings are valid, prior to re-running the simulation with a better shapeQuality setting. Use apex.gendes.ShapeQuality.Balanced (Default) for a simulation that balances compute time with quality of the computed shape. Use apex.gendes.ShapeQuality.FineTune for a simulation that generates the best quality of the computed shape.

#### `getStrutDensity() -> StrutDensity`
Enumeration argument to guide the type of shape that will be generated by the solver. In order to meet different end user manufacturing, functional or aesthetic considerations the generative design solver can be directed to generated different types of shapes. Setting this argument to "Sparse" will cause the solver to preferentially generate shapes that may include many fine or narrow regions whereas setting the value to "Dense" will cause the final shape to have fewer but larger regions.

returns the AdvancedSettingGenerativeDesign object from this Scenario. If a AdvancedSettingGenerativeDesign object does not exits for this Scenario the method will return None

#### `setBuildDirection(buildDirection: apex.IOrientation) -> None`
Define the build direction using an orientation object. Please Note: So the default value should be got from the associated material. (we provide a private member for the related material of the current analysis scenario. From the material we can get the materialType and the material coverageRegions. From the coverageRegions object,we can get the material orientation.) If buildDirection is set to None, switch to use the material orientation. If buildDirection is set to an IOrientation object, switch to use the defined orientation.

#### `setComplexity(complexity: float) -> None`
indirectly controls the initial complexity of the model during simulation by specifying the amount of memory to use for the simulation. Higher values for complexity will cause the solution to generated a very fine grained simulation model which generally leads to "better" final shapes, but at the expense of compute time.
