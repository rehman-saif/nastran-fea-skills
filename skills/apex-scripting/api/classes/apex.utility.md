classes have no setters: change them with `obj.update(...)`.

## `apex.utility.PolyData`
A class that supports operations on points and cells. The cells can be linear or quadratic triangles or quadrilaterals. The point and cell data may be composed directly by the class or provided by a suitable external object such as a SurfaceMesh. NOTE : In the current Apex release the point and cell data is ONLY supported through reference to an external SurfaceMesh NOTE : In future releases the types of supported external objects will be expanded to include SolidMesh (tetrahedral) and HexMesh (hexa/penta) mesh types where the free faces of the mesh will be used to define the PolyData. NOTE : In current Apex releases PolyData objects are not persisted although this will likely change in future releases In the current Apex release the primary purpose of the PolyData class is to support the creation of geometry FacetedSurfaces, however future releases will leverage this same data structure for many other purposes including construction and display of user defined shapes and to support mapping of attributes between different meshes. In addition to defining the point locations and cell topologies a PolyData supports the concept of higher level topological organization of the raw points and cells into topological faces, edges and vertices. Topological faces are defined by groups of contiguous 2D cells, edges by groups of contiguous cell edges and vertices as individual points. Methods are provided to organize and introspect the groups of cells, cell edges and points that define the higher level topology. The class internally imposes the rules required to maintain viable topology - cells may be associated with just a single topological face, topological faces must contain only cells that are contiguous, a topological vertex must exits at each end of a topological edge, topological vertices must lie on a topological edge etc. PolyData also supports named Sets that can define arbitrary groups of mixed PolyData primitives. The Sets are not managed by the class as operations are executed and it is the users responsibility to ensure that the contents of the Sets remain synchronized with the underlying primitives.

- `faceIDs` — A List of integers defining the ID's of the Faces that the method will attempt to merge
- `vertexAngle` — An optional angle (default is 40 degrees) that will be used to automatically decide if one children vertex need to be removed when one topology edge is removed during face merge. This argument represents a measure of angle and must be supplied in the angle units defined in the active ScriptUnitSystem.

The default "Add" option will cause all of the supplied cell edges to be added to the topologyEdges set. Any input cell edges that would result in duplicate cell edges in topologyEdges are silently ignored to ensure that topologyEdges contains only unique cell edges. The "Remove" option will cause all of the supplied cell edges to be removed from the topologyEdges set. Any input cell edges that are not already in topologyEdges will be silently ignored The "Toggle" option will cause all of the supplied cell edges that are already in the topologyEdges set to be removed from topologyEdges and all supplied cell edges that are NOT already in topologyEdges to be added.

#### `updateToplogyVertices(pointIDs: str, addRemoveBehavior: apex.utility.AddRemoveBehavior) -> None`
modifies the set of points in the Tessellation that will be identified as Vertex points. This class maintains a list of points that will be used to define vertices and this method modifies that list. This method accepts a list of points and an updateBehavior argument and causes the supplied points to be added to or removed from the internal vertex depending on the value provided for updateBehavior. The input points are identified by ID and must exist within the object, otherwise the method will throw an exception.

- `pointIDs` — The set of points to be added to or removed from the object vertexPoints set
- `addRemoveBehavior` — optional argument that defines how the supplied points will be processed. The default "Add" option will cause all of the supplied points to be added to the vertexPoints list. Any input points that would result in duplicate points in the vertexPoints set are silently ignored to ensure that the set contains only unique points. The "Remove" option will cause all of the supplied points to be removed from the vertexPoints set. Any input points that are not already in the vertexPoints set will be silently ignored The "Toggle" option will cause all of the supplied points that are already in the vertexPoints set to be removed from the set and all supplied points that are NOT already in the vertexPoint set to added to the point set.


## `apex.utility.ProximitySearch`
The ProximitySearch class is provided to support very fast determination of the objects (or objects) that are closest to a given target location (or object) or that lie within an axis aligned box in global 3D space. To use this class, insert all of the objects that you need to consider in the proximity calculation - performance is proportional to the number of objects that are inserted so for best performance, limit the number of objects that you add. Several methods are provided to add individual objects or lists/collections of objects. Only object that support the ILocation interface can be added to a ProximitySearch object. When the object is populated with all candidate objects, use the 'findXXX()' methods to determine which of the candidate objects is closest to the target location or lie within the bounding box.

#### `findNearestObject(location: apex.ILocation) -> apex.utility.ZResultfindNearestObject`
DEPRECATED: In releases of Apex prior to Iberian Lynx this argument was of type apex.construct.Point3D. In the Iberian Lynx release the argument type has been changed to apex.ILocation. For the Iberian Lynx release, users may continue to pass Point3D objects however this capability may be deprecated in a future release therefore users are advised to transition their code to use apex.ILocation as quickly as possible to avoid future problems.

- `location` — Specifies the location want to find the entity

Returns: true if successful

This method takes a target location in 3D space as an argument and returns a result object that includes the candidate object within the ProximitySearch object that is closest to the target location. All proximity calculations use the "location" attribute of the candidate objects as their basis so for 1D, 2D and 3D objects, some portions of the object may lie closer to or further away from the target location than the single distance value indicates. For example, for an edge or manifold curve, the distance is between the target location and the mid point of the edge or manifold curve. For a solid, the distance is between the target location and the centroid of the solid..

This method takes a target location in 3D space and a distance as input and returns all objects in the candidate set that are closer to (or the same distance from) the target location than the specified distance. All proximity calculations use the "location" attribute of the candidate objects as their basis so for 1D, 2D and 3D objects, some portions of the object may lie closer to or further away from the target location than the single distance values indicates. All candidate objects that lie within this distance (including exactly matching this distance) of the target location will be returned. Candidate objects further away from the target than this distance will be omitted.
