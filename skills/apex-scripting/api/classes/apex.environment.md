# apex.environment — classes

Properties are read via `obj.prop` or `obj.getProp()`. Entity-derived
classes have no setters: change them with `obj.update(...)`.

## `apex.environment.Constraint`  (extends `Entity`, `IDisplayable`, `IUserHighlightable`, `IUserAttributes`, `IName`)
A constraint fixes one or more degrees of freedom during the simulation. Currently only structural displacement degrees of freedom can be constrained since Apex only supports structural simulation at this time.

## `apex.environment.ConstraintDisplacement`  (extends `Constraint`)
A displacement constraint that applies displacements in one or more degrees of freedom to Nodes. It can be used as a constraint or an enforced displacement. The constant constraint may be applied to one or more Nodes directly or through their association to mesh bodies and/or geometry bodies. When used to generate a Nastran model this class will create one or more SPC entries for each Node. Apex supports a sets of pre-configured combinations of degrees of freedom to enable more convenient and robust constraint definitions by specifying the constraintType.

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldAccelerationNodal`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying acceleration magnitude across a multiplicity of nodes. Each "row" in this table identifies a node and the temperature data for that node. The table includes ten "columns", nodeIds, pathNames pathIndices accelerationVectorsX accelerationVectorsY accelerationVectorsZ orientations scaleFactors The acceleration vectors may be blank but at least one should be defined for each associated node so that the acceleration vector is not zero. Apex supports duplicate Node IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify a Node it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Node in this field a more compact scheme is used. "nodeIds" - a list defining the ID of every node in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every node in nodeIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'nodeIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every node in the field. This list has the same number of entries as nodeIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated node. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with any node in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the node ID entry in nodeIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: nodeIds=[ 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ] In this field, nodes 1000 and 1001 belong to "Mesh 1", while nodes 1002 and 1003 belong to "Mesh 2". The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact node identification scheme. To print the pathName and acceleration associated with each node in the field, the following code could be used, for index, node_id in enumerate(nodeIds): print('Node with ID', node_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has an acceleration in X component of', accelerationVectorsX[index])

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldConstraintDisplacement`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying constraint across a multiplicity of nodes. Each "row" in this table identifies a node and the constraint data on that node. The table includes the following "columns", nodeIds pathNames pathIndices orientations translationsX translationsY translationsZ rotationsX rotationsY rotationsZ Apex supports duplicate Node IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify a Node it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Node in this field a more compact scheme is used. "nodeIds" - a list defining the ID of every node in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every node in nodeIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'nodeIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every Node in the field. This list has the same number of entries as nodeIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated Node. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with a Node in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the Node ID entry in nodeIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: nodeIds=[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ] There are two mesh bodies with same nodes ids in two different parts. The pathNames is used to identify which mesh body is associated with the node. The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact node identification scheme. To print the pathName and constraint in X component associated with each Node in the field, the following code could be used, for index, element_id in enumerate(nodeIds): print('Node with ID', node_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a displacement constraint in translation X ', translationX[index]).

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldConstraintExcludeAuto`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying exclude across a multiplicity of nodes. Each "row" in this table identifies a node and the exclude data on that node. The table includes the following "columns", nodeIds pathNames pathIndices excludeTranslationX excludeTranslationY excludeTranslationZ excludeRotationX excludeRotationY excludeRotationZ Apex supports duplicate Node IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify a Node it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Node in this field a more compact scheme is used. "nodeIds" - a list defining the ID of every node in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every node in nodeIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'nodeIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every Node in the field. This list has the same number of entries as nodeIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated Node. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with a Node in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the Node ID entry in nodeIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: nodeIds=[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ] There are two mesh bodies with same nodes ids in two different parts. The pathNames is used to identify which mesh body is associated with the node. The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact node identification scheme. To print the pathName and exclude in X component associated with each Node in the field, the following code could be used, for index, element_id in enumerate(nodeIds): print('Node with ID', node_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a exclude in translation X is ', excludeTranslationX[index]).

In order to uniquely identify an Element it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Element in this field a more compact scheme is used. "elementIds" - a list defining the ID of every element in the field.

For example: nodeIds=[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ] There are two mesh bodies with same nodes ids in two different parts. The pathNames is used to identify which mesh body is associated with the node. The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact node identification scheme. To print the pathName and motion in X component associated with each Node in the field, the following code could be used, for index, element_id in enumerate(nodeIds): print('Node with ID', node_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a motion in X component of', motionsX[index]).

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldInitialDisplacementVelocity`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying initial displacement and velocity across a multiplicity of elements. Each "row" in this table identifies a node and the initial displacement and velocity data for that face The table includes ten "columns", nodeIds pathNames pathIndices displacementsX displacementsY ldisplacementsZ displacementsRx displacementsRy displacementsRz velocitiesX velocitiesY velocitiesZ velocitiesRx velocitiesRy velocitiesRz Apex supports duplicate Node IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify a Node it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Node in this field a more compact scheme is used. "nodeIds" - a list defining the ID of every node in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every node in nodeIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'nodeIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every node in the field. This list has the same number of entries as nodeIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated node. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with any node in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the node ID entry in nodeIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: nodeIds=[ 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ] In this field, nodes 1000 and 1001 belong to "Mesh 1", while nodes 1002 and 1003 belong to "Mesh 2". The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact node identification scheme. To print the pathName and displacement and velocity associated with each node in the field, the following code could be used, for index, node_id in enumerate(nodeIds): print('Node with ID', node_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has an initial displacement in X component', displacementsX[index])

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldLoadAreaFactor`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying load area factor across a multiplicity of nodes. Each "row" in this table identifies a node and the load area factor data on that node. The table includes the following "columns", nodeIds pathNames pathIndices scaleFactorsX scaleFactorsY scaleFactorsZ scaleFactorsRx scaleFactorsRy scaleFactorsRz Apex supports duplicate Node IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify a Node it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Node in this field a more compact scheme is used. "nodeIds" - a list defining the ID of every node in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every node in nodeIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'nodeIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every Node in the field. This list has the same number of entries as nodeIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated Node. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with a Node in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the Node ID entry in nodeIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: nodeIds=[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ] There are two mesh bodies with same nodes ids in two different parts. The pathNames is used to identify which mesh body is associated with the node. The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact node identification scheme. To print the pathName and load area factor in X component associated with each Node in the field, the following code could be used, for index, element_id in enumerate(nodeIds): print('Node with ID', node_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a load area factor in X component of', scaleFactorsX[index]).

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldLoadDistributed`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying distributed load magnitude across a multiplicity of elements/element faces. Each "row" in this table identifies an element or element face and the load data for that face The table includes ten "columns", elementIds, pathIndices pressuresP1 pressuresP2 pressuresP3 pressuresP4 nodesP1 nodesP2 nodesP3 nodesP4 directionsX directionsY directionsZ orientations Pressure values for the first corner MUST be defined and will be used for all other corners if they are omitted. Defining only values for the first corner of each element/face enables creation of an "Element Uniform" pressure distribution where the pressure varies across different elements but is constant within a single element. Providing values for the second, third and fourth corners enables definition of a pressure that varies not only across different elements but also varies within a single element. The fourth corner values are silently ignored if the element/face is triangular and has just three corner nodes. Directions defines the pressure direction relative to the coordinate systems in orientations. Apex supports duplicate Element IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify an Element it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Element in this field a more compact scheme is used. "elementIds" - a list defining the ID of every element in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every element in elementIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'elementIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every Element in the field. This list has the same number of entries as elementIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated Element. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with any Element in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the Element ID entry in elementIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: elementIds=[ 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ] In this field, elements 1000 and 1001 belong to "Mesh 1", while elements 1002 and 1003 belong to "Mesh 2". The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact element identification scheme. To print the pathName and first corner pressure associated with each Element in the field, the following code could be used, for index, element_id in enumerate(elementIds): print('Element with ID', element_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a first corner pressure of', pressuresCorner1[index])

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldLoadDistributedBeam3`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying load across a multiplicity of 1D elements. Each "row" in this table identifies an element and the load data for that element. The table includes ten "columns", elementIds loadTypes scaleTypes distancesX1 loadFactorsX1 distancesX2 loadFactorsX2 pathNames pathIndices Apex supports duplicate Element IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify an Element it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Element in this field a more compact scheme is used. "elementIds" - a list defining the ID of every element in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every element in elementIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'elementIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every Element in the field. This list has the same number of entries as elementIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated Element. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with any Element in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the Element ID entry in elementIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: elementIds=[ 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ] In this field, elements 1000 and 1001 belong to "Mesh 1", while elements 1002 and 1003 belong to "Mesh 2". The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact element identification scheme. To print the pathName and load associated with each Element in the field, the following code could be used, for index, element_id in enumerate(elementIds): print('Element with ID', element_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a distributed load of', distancesX1[index])

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldMomentFollowerVector`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying moment across a multiplicity of nodes. Each "row" in this table identifies a node and the moment data on that node. The table includes the following "columns", nodeIds pathNames pathIndices momentMagnitudes points1 points2 Apex supports duplicate Node IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify a Node it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Node in this field a more compact scheme is used. "nodeIds" - a list defining the ID of every node in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every node in nodeIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'nodeIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every Node in the field. This list has the same number of entries as nodeIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated Node. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with a Node in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the Node ID entry in nodeIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: nodeIds=[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ] There are two mesh bodies with same nodes ids in two different parts. The pathNames is used to identify which mesh body is associated with the node. The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact node identification scheme. To print the pathName and moment associated with each Node in the field, the following code could be used, for index, element_id in enumerate(nodeIds): print('Node with ID', node_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a moment magnitude of', momentsMagnitude[index]).

Apex supports duplicate Node IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify a Node it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Node in this field a more compact scheme is used. "nodeIds" - a list defining the ID of every node in the field.

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldPressure`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying pressure magnitude across a multiplicity of elements/element faces.

Defining only values for the first corner of each element/face enables creation of an "Element Uniform" pressure distribution where the pressure varies across different elements but is constant within a single element. Providing values for the second, third and fourth corners enables definition of a pressure that varies not only across different elements but also varies within a single element. The fourth corner values are silently ignored if the element/face is triangular and has just three corner nodes. Apex supports duplicate Element IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify an Element it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Element in this field a more compact scheme is used. "elementIds" - a list defining the ID of every element in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every element in elementIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'elementIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every Element in the field. This list has the same number of entries as elementIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated Element. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with any Element in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the Element ID entry in elementIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: elementIds=[ 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ] In this field, elements 1000 and 1001 belong to "Mesh 1", while elements 1002 and 1003 belong to "Mesh 2".

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldSupportFreeBody`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying support across a multiplicity of nodes. Each "row" in this table identifies a node and the support data on that node. The table includes the following "columns", nodeIds pathNames pathIndices orientations constrainTranslationX constrainTranslationY constrainTranslationZ constrainRotationX constrainRotationY constrainRotationZ Apex supports duplicate Node IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify a Node it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Node in this field a more compact scheme is used. "nodeIds" - a list defining the ID of every node in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every node in nodeIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'nodeIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every Node in the field. This list has the same number of entries as nodeIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated Node. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with a Node in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the Node ID entry in nodeIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: nodeIds=[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ] There are two mesh bodies with same nodes ids in two different parts. The pathNames is used to identify which mesh body is associated with the node. The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact node identification scheme. To print the pathName and constraint in X component associated with each Node in the field, the following code could be used, for index, element_id in enumerate(nodeIds): print('Node with ID', node_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a support in translation X is ', constrainTranslationX[index]).

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldTemperatureGradientBeam3`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying temperatures across a multiplicity of elements. Each "row" in this table identifies an element and the temperature data for that face The table includes ten "columns", elementIds, pathNames pathIndices thermalGradientsYA thermalGradientsZA thermalGradientsYB thermalGradientsZB thermalGradientsYC thermalGradientsZC temperaturesPointCendA temperaturesPointDendA temperaturesPointEendA temperaturesPointFendA temperaturesPointCendB temperaturesPointDendB temperaturesPointEendB temperaturesPointFendB temperaturesPointCmidC temperaturesPointDmidC temperaturesPointEmidC temperaturesPointFmidC Temperature values at endA, endB and midC MUST be defined. Apex supports duplicate Element IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify an Element it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Element in this field a more compact scheme is used. "elementIds" - a list defining the ID of every element in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every element in elementIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'elementIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every Element in the field. This list has the same number of entries as elementIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated Element. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with any Element in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the Element ID entry in elementIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: elementIds=[ 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ] In this field, elements 1000 and 1001 belong to "Mesh 1", while elements 1002 and 1003 belong to "Mesh 2". The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact element identification scheme. To print the pathName and temperature associated with each Element in the field, the following code could be used, for index, element_id in enumerate(elementIds): print('Element with ID', element_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a temperature of', temperaturesEndA[index])

## `apex.environment.DFEMFieldTemperatureNodal`
A class describing a table like data structure defining the spatially varying pressure magnitude across a multiplicity of nodes. Each "row" in this table identifies a node and the temperature data for that node. The table includes ten "columns", nodeIds, pathNames pathIndices temperatures Temperature values MUST be defined and is associated with the nodes defined in nodeIds. Apex supports duplicate Node IDs within a single Apex model. In order to uniquely identify a Node it is necessary to define both its ID and the MeshBody to which it is associated. In order to avoid storing a potentially large pathName string for every Node in this field a more compact scheme is used. "nodeIds" - a list defining the ID of every node in the field. "pathNames" - a list of unique pathNames. Every node in nodeIds is composed by one of the MeshBodies included in this List. Since a MeshBody appears a maximum of once in this list it typically has many fewer entries than 'nodeIds'. "pathIndices" - The indices of the MeshBody pathName for every node in the field. This list has the same number of entries as nodeIds and uses the same sequence. Each entry in pathIndices represents an index into pathNames that identifies the pathName of the MeshBody of the associated node. To define or determine the MeshBody associated with any node in the field use the entry in pathIndices corresponding to the node ID entry in nodeIds to lookup the MeshBody pathName in pathNames. For example: nodeIds=[ 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 ], pathNames = [ apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 1", apex.currentModel().name + "/Part 1/Mesh 2" ] pathIndices = [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ] In this field, nodes 1000 and 1001 belong to "Mesh 1", while nodes 1002 and 1003 belong to "Mesh 2". The following code snippet may be useful to help understand the compact node identification scheme. To print the pathName and temperature associated with each node in the field, the following code could be used, for index, node_id in enumerate(nodeIds): print('Node with ID', node_id, 'is associated with MeshBody', pathNames[pathIndices[index], 'and has a temperature of', temperatures[index])

## `apex.environment.LoadAreaFactorVariable`  (extends `Load`)
This class represents a load scale(area) factor in the six components. The translation components can be used a force vector while translation components can be used a moment vector in static analysis. A single instance of this class may include a multiplicity of individual load area factor each applied to a different Node. All of the individual load area factors are composed by this LoadAreaFactor and share a common ID. When used in a Nastran simulation this class will give rise to a DAREA entry for each component on each Node within the scope of the region to which it is associated. LoadAreaFactor can be configured to represent either a spatially constant or spatially varying field of load area factors. The spatially constant configuration defines a single load area factor and direction and assigns it to all Nodes in the target region. The spatially varying configuration uses a field of load area factors to assign a different load area factors to each Node in the target region. Instances of this class can be created using the apex.environment.createLoadAreaFactor() or apex.environment.createLoadAreaFactorVariable() functions.

This class represents a spatially varying distributed load applied to 2D elements or the faces of 3D elements. The load direction is defined by three components in a coordinate system. A single instance of this class may include a multiplicity of individual distributed loads each applied to a different element/element face. All of the individual loads composed by this load share a common ID. When used in a Nastran simulation this class will give rise to one PLOAD4 entry for each element/element face within the scope of the region with which it is associated. The variation of distributed loads across the elements that this load references is defined using a DFEMFieldLoadDistributed. This field defines both the elements/element faces that represent the region to which this load is applied as well as the variation of load values across that region. Two different types of load distributions are supported by DFEMFieldLoadDistributed, "Element uniform" distributions enable definition of a single distributed load value for each element/element face within the scope of the load "Element variable" distributions enable definition of a unique distributed load values at each corner node of each element/element face within the scope of this load.

Instances of this class can be created using the apex.environment.createLoadEnforcedMotionTotal() or apex.environment.createLoadEnforcedMotionTotalVariable() functions. Note: the total enforced motion can be only used as a relative enforced displacement in nonlinear analysis.

All of the individual enforced motions are composed by this LoadEnforcedMotionTotal and share a common ID. When used in a Nastran simulation this class will give rise to a SPCD entry with a SPC1 entry for component and each Node within the scope of the region to which it is associated. LoadEnforcedMotionTotalVariable can be configured to represent either a spatially constant or spatially varying field of enforced motions. The spatially constant configuration defines an enforced motion and direction and assigns it to all Nodes in the target region. The spatially varying configuration uses a field of enforced motions and coordinate systems to assign a different enforced motion to each Node in the target region. Instances of this class can be created using the apex.environment.createLoadEnforcedMotionTotal() or apex.environment.createLoadEnforcedMotionTotalVariable() functions. Note: the total enforced motion can be used as enforced displacement for static analysis and enforced motion(displacement, velocity and acceleration) for dynamic analysis. In nonlinear analysis, it is a total enforced displacement for a step.

Each MeshBody that has one or more elements referenced by the variable pressure load will be included in the top level dictionary. For example, is a pressure is applied to elements on two different MeshBodies the top level dictionary will include two items - {"Model_1/Part 1/Mesh 1?: {dict1}, "Model_1/Part 2/Mesh 2": {dict2}} The secondary dictionary contains the information about which elements/element faces are included in the variable pressure load and the pressure values applied to each. A variable pressure load may have a single constant value per 2D element or 3D element face or may have different values defined at each corner node of 2D elements or 3D element faces. The type of distribution is identified in the secondary dictionary by the "identifier_type"key which is a string type. The associated value is a string type that must be one of the following values, "ELEMENT_ID", "ELEMENT_ID_FACE_INDEX", "ELEMENT_ID_FACE_NODE_ID" If identifier_type is ELEMENT_ID, the pressure field is defined using a single pressure value per 2D element and the secondary dictionary items with "element_ids" and "pressures" keys identify the 2D elements and pressure values. The value associated with the element_ids key is a List of integers, each integer identifying the element id. The value associated with the pressures key is a List of floats, each integer identifying the single pressure value associated with the corresponding element. The element_ids and pressure lists must be of equal length with the pressure value indices aligned with the element ids indices. If identifier_type is ELEMENT_ID_FACE_INDEX, the remainder of the pressure field is defined using a single pressure value per 3D element face and the secondary dictionary items with "element_ids" "face_identifiers" and "pressures" identify the 3D element faces and pressure values. The value associated with the element_ids key is a List of integers, each integer identifying the id of a 3D element. The value associated with the "face_identifiers" key is a List of integers, each integer identifying a face on the associated 3D element. (Face indices per 3D element type are documented elsewhere). The value associated with the pressures key is a List of floats, each integer identifying the single pressure value associated with the corresponding element face. The element_ids, identifiers and pressures lists must be of equal length with the pressure value indices aligned with the element ids/Element face indices. If identifier_type is ELEMENT_ID_FACE_NODE_ID, the remainder of the pressure field is defined using multiple pressure values per 2D element or 3D element face ?one pressure value for each corner node of the 2D element or 3D element face and the secondary dictionary items with "element_ids" "face_identifiers" and "pressures" identify the 2D Elements or 3D element faces and pressure values. The value associated with the element_ids key is a List of integers, each integer identifying the id of a 2D or 3D element. The value associated with the "face_identifiers" key is a List of Lists of integers. Each internal integer List identifies the corner nodes of the 2D element or 3D element face. There must be the same number of internal integer lists as there are IDs in element_ids, The value associated with the pressures key is a List of Lists of floats, Each internal list identifies the pressure values at the corner nodes of the associated 2D element or 3D element face. There must be the same number of internal float lists as there are IDs in element_ids and the pressure values must be aligned with the element corner node indices. Example : Pressure field defined on 3 2D elements with a single pressure per element { "identifier_type": "ELEMENT_ID" "element_ids": [1, 2, 6], "pressures": [15.0, 21.6, 35.9] } Example : Pressure field defined on 3 3D elements with a single pressure per element { "identifier_type": "ELEMENT_ID_FACE_INDEX" "element_ids": [11, 23, 915], "face_identifiers": [0, 3, 2], "pressures": [15.0, 21.6, 35.9] } Example : Pressure field defined on 3 elements with different pressures for one 2D element or 3D element face { "identifier_type": "ELEMENT_ID_FACE_NODE_ID" "element_ids": [11, 23, 915], "face_identifiers": [[15, 16, 18, 21], [17, 5, 89, 6], [99, 89, 70, 65]], "pressures": [[15.0, 17.6, 18.9, 17.2], [14.0, 17.2, 17.2], [13.2, 14.6, 15.9, 11.2]] } THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN THE FUTURE RELEASE.

For example, a LoadTemperature is applied to two different MeshBodies the top level dictionary will include two items - {"Model_1/Part 1/Mesh 1" : {dict1}, "Model_1/Part 2/Mesh 2": {dict2}} The secondary dictionary contains the information about which nodes are included in the variable LoadTemperature and the temperature values applied to each node. The type of distribution is identified in the secondary dictionary by the "identifier_type" key which is a string type. The associated value is a string type that must be "NODE_ID" as Apex only supports nodal temperature in 2021.1 release. For identifier type of NODE_ID, the temperature field is defined by the secondary dictionary items with "node_ids" and "temperatures" keys that identify the nodes IDs and temperature values. The value associated with the node_ids key is a List of integers, each integer identifying the node id. The value associated with the temperatures key is a List of floats, each float identifying the single temperature value associated with the corresponding node. The node_ids and temperatures lists must be of equal length with the temperature values indices aligned with the node ids indices. Example : LoadTemperature defined on three nodes of "Mesh 1" in "Model_1". {"Model_1/Part 1/Mesh 1" : { "identifier_type" : "NODE_ID", "node_ids" : [1000,1001,1002], "temperatures" : [301.52,302.78,303.92] } } THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN THE FUTURE RELEASE.

## `apex.environment.LoadTraction`  (extends `Entity`, `IDisplayable`, `IUserHighlightable`, `IUserAttributes`, `IName`)
LoadTraction is used to define a distributed load across a model region. THIS CLASS IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN THE FUTURE RELEASE. Users should be working with classes: LoadDistributed, LoadTotal. The magnitude and/or the direction of the load may be defined as a: Constant load per unit area or load per unit length, causing the constant load/(area, length) value to be applied equally to every element in the target region. Spatially varying load per unit area or load per unit length, causing a field of load/(area, length) values to be applied to every element/node in the target region. Single value representing the total aggregate force, causing a distribution of individual loads across the elements/nodes in the target region. In current release, Apex only supports static and constant LoadTractionProperty: LoadTractionPropertyStaticConstant LoadTractionPropertyStaticTotal Note that the properties for 1D and 2D types use different properties since the quantity is different - 2D LoadTractions are defined as load/unit area and 1D LoadTractions are defined as load/unit length. Only 2D type is supported in 2021.2 release.
