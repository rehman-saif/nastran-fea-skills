description: Write, review, debug or generate MSC Apex Python code. Use for requests to produce a script, utility, macro, custom tool or plugin, to fix or improve existing Apex Python, or to find the right apex module, function signature, enum member or entity property before writing code — covering model and part traversal, geometry, meshing, materials and attribution, loads and constraints, studies and scenarios, results, session and viewport control, import and export, and tool panels built with the apex_sdk GUI SDK. Carries the generated Apex API reference (989 functions, 5108 class methods, 237 enums, 733 classes) with per-argument documentation, a map from FE terms (glue, RBE2, SPC, subcase) to Apex calls, and verified SOL 101 model-building recipes. For how to do something in the Apex GUI rather than in code, use apex-docs. For Nastran deck keywords use nastran-reference, and for solver messages use nastran-diagnostics.

# Apex scripting

## Overview

MSC Apex is scripted with a single Python package, `apex`, spanning 22 modules.
Plugins ("custom tools") add a native-looking tool panel on top of that API
using a separate .NET/WPF GUI SDK, `apex_sdk`.

This skill bundles a generated, authoritative API reference. **Look the call up
before writing it.** Apex signatures are large, keyword-only, and full of
near-miss enum names, so recalled code is usually wrong in a way that only
fails at runtime.

## Required workflow

1. **Classify the deliverable.** Decide which of these the user needs, because
   the architecture differs completely:
   - a **batch script** — runs start to finish, no user input
   - a **custom tool (`ui_tool`)** — a panel with inputs and/or entity picking
   - a **custom tool (`batch_tool`)** — a palette button over a batch script
   - a **remote script** — drives Apex from an external interpreter
   - a **fix** to existing code
2. **Read the conventions.** [references/cheat-sheet.md](references/cheat-sheet.md)
   before writing any Apex code. Keyword-only arguments, `update()` instead of
   setters, and `ZResult` returns account for most broken generated scripts.
   [references/scripting-model.md](references/scripting-model.md) is the full
   version, for when a rule needs its explanation.
3. **Locate the functionality.** Follow the lookup order below. Do not write a
   call you have not found in `api/`.
4. **Generate only once the API is grounded.** Confirm the module, function
   signature, enum members and entity properties first, then write code.
5. **Validate before finishing.** Run
   [references/script-quality-checklist.md](references/script-quality-checklist.md).

## Documentation lookup order

1. [references/documentation-index.md](references/documentation-index.md) — the
   full doc surface and navigation rules.
2. [references/fe-vocabulary.md](references/fe-vocabulary.md) — when the task
   is phrased in FE terms (glue, RBE2, spider, SPC, PSOLID, subcase, output
   request), find the Apex name here first. The API never uses those words.
3. [references/module-selection.md](references/module-selection.md) — map the
   task to one of the 22 modules.
4. `api/functions-index.md` — grep for a verb or noun to find a module function.
5. `api/methods-index.md` — grep for a class method (`Study.createScenarioNastran`,
   `LoadCaseItem.getCommand`). Scenarios, subcases and interactions are set up
   almost entirely through methods.
6. `api/modules/<module>.md` — exact signature, argument names, defaults.
7. `api/enums.md` — confirm every enum member. Never invent one.
8. `api/classes/<module>.md` — entity properties and methods. Each class lists
   every signature first and the documentation under "Method details". Members
   shown are those declared on the class; inherited ones are under the base
   classes named in its `(extends ...)` header.
9. Per-parameter documentation is inline in `api/modules/` and `api/classes/`
   under each signature — there is no separate source to drill into.

Grep the flat indexes before opening a module file. `apex.environment` and
`apex.studies` class files are large — grep those rather than reading them.

An index line tagged **[raises at runtime in Apex 2024.1]**,
**[fails silently at runtime in Apex 2024.1]** or **[runtime note in Apex
2024.1]** means the call behaves differently from the reference on a real
install. Read the note under its signature before using it.

All documentation is inside this skill folder. The original 1.76 GB
documentation set is not bundled and must not be searched.

## Script generation rules

1. `import apex` at the top; it makes every module available.
2. Set `apex.setScriptUnitSystem(...)` before creating or measuring geometry.
3. Pass **every** argument by keyword. Apex supports no positional arguments.
4. Change entity properties with `update()`. Assignment silently does nothing.
5. Build targets as an `apex.EntityCollection` via `appendList`, not as a Python
   list. Use `.len()`, not `len()`.
6. Treat returns as single values; read multi-value results off the `ZResult*`
   object's properties.
7. Prefer bulk module functions over per-entity loops.
8. Use `recursive=True` when nested assemblies are in scope.
9. Separate lookup, filtering, mutation and reporting into clear blocks.
10. Report progress with `apex.session.displayStatusMessage` for slow work.
11. Guard operations that can genuinely fail; let everything else raise.

Start from [assets/template_batch_script.py](assets/template_batch_script.py).
To build a linear static model (materials, PSOLID, mesh, glue, RBE2 spiders,
beam bolts, constraints, loads, a SOL 101 scenario with subcases, export),
build from section 12 of
[references/patterns-and-recipes.md](references/patterns-and-recipes.md). Those
steps ran in Apex 2024.1.

## Custom tool rules

A `ui_tool` is always **two Python files**, and mixing them is the main failure
mode:

| File | Runs as | Imports | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mytool_ui.py` | IronPython, Apex UI process | `apex_sdk`, `clr`, `System.*` | build the panel, gather input |
| `mytool.py` | Apex CPython | `apex` | do the modelling |

1. `getUIContent()` is mandatory and must return a `ToolPropertyContainer`.
2. The UI file never imports `apex`; the worker never imports `apex_sdk`.
3. `@apex_sdk.errorhandler` on **every** event handler — without it an uncaught
   exception terminates Apex.
4. Reach the API only through `apex_sdk.runScriptFunction()` or
   `runScript()`. Calling worker code directly stalls the UI.
5. Dictionary values arrive as strings; cast them in the worker.
6. Declare controls the Apply handler reads as `global`.
7. Constrain input with a pick filter rather than filtering after the fact.
8. The folder tree *is* the configuration — names in `palette.xml`,
   `group.xml`, `tool.xml` and the folders must agree, and `runfile` names the
   **UI** file for a `ui_tool`.

Use [references/custom-tool-authoring.md](references/custom-tool-authoring.md)
for the structure, [references/gui-sdk-reference.md](references/gui-sdk-reference.md)
for the `apex_sdk` surface, and
[references/gui-sdk-patterns.md](references/gui-sdk-patterns.md) for WPF layout.
Copy [assets/custom_tool_template/](assets/custom_tool_template/) as a starting
point.

## Debugging rules

1. Establish whether the code is a batch script, a worker, or UI code.
2. Verify the call exists and its signature matches before reading logic.
3. A script that runs but changes nothing is usually property assignment
   instead of `update()`, or an empty target collection.
4. A frozen Apex means model work on the UI thread.
5. A terminated Apex means a missing `@apex_sdk.errorhandler`.
6. A tool that never appears is a name mismatch in the palette/group/tool XML.
7. A model or deck that is wrong although nothing raised is usually one of the
   silent failures in sections 17–22 of [references/pitfalls.md](references/pitfalls.md):
   an ignored `MID`, subcase case control that did not persist, glue without
   `BCONTACT`.

Use [references/debugging-playbook.md](references/debugging-playbook.md) for
symptom-driven triage and [references/pitfalls.md](references/pitfalls.md) for
the specific traps.

## Version

`api/` is generated from the **Iberian Lynx FP2** (May 2024) API reference and
is authoritative for what exists. The concept and custom tool material derives
from Apex 2021.4 / Python 3.8.2 documentation; tool authoring and the GUI SDK
have been stable across those releases. When a user names a specific Apex
release and a signature could differ, say where the signature came from.

Where Apex 2024.1 is known to behave differently from that reference, the
difference is recorded in `tools/runtime_overrides.json` and stamped into
`api/` by the generator.
